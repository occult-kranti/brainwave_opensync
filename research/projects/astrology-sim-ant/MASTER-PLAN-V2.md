# Master Plan v2 — refreshed (2026-06-25)

> ## ⚠ SUPERSEDED FOR PLANNING
>
> **The live direction is [`MASTER-PLAN-V3.md`](MASTER-PLAN-V3.md); the round-level queue is [`docs/plans/LOOP.md`](docs/plans/LOOP.md)**; the
> continuation prompt is [`docs/plans/HANDOFF.md`](docs/plans/HANDOFF.md).
> Kept for its round log. The "REMAINING" section below is five weeks stale and
> is not the queue.

The original handoff plan (`ROADMAP.md`) is **executed through Phase T**. This file is the
authoritative, current status + the remaining step-by-step work, including the two features
added this round (Location service, Life Trajectory). Pairs with `COVERAGE.md` (audit),
`REVIEW.md` (the critical + mathematician's-lens review with experimental features & the R1/R2
plan), and `HANDOFF.md` (environment/ship). Every phase ends at the **`verify-site`** gate.

> **Verified each round:** `node scripts/audit.mjs` (0 problems), `node scripts/engine-test.mjs`
> (all pass — now incl. trajectory + location), and the 31-page real-Chromium sweep (0 console errors).

## ✅ DONE & verified
- **Phase 0** — docs reconciled (ROADMAP/HANDOFF/COVERAGE), skills in `.claude/skills/`.
- **Phase 1** — Picatrix/fixed-star data (28 mansions, 15 Behenian w/ live precession, 36 faces,
  7-planet magic) + reference pages.
- **Phase 2A/2B** — `core/election.js` (electionScore/rankNow/findNextElection, via-combusta+Spica,
  moonDispositor) + Election page + live `now.html`.
- **Phase 2C** — natal engine (`profections`, `hyleg`+alcocoden, `directions`, `solar-return`) +
  Book III Master + Unified Master Tool.
- **Phase T** — `core/talisman.js` + the guided Talisman Workflow page.
- **This round — Location service** (`app/location.js`): `useMyLocation()`, offline `nearestCity()`,
  `attachGeolocate()`. **Wired into `shared.js` `wireCitySelect`**, so *every* tool now shows a
  "📍 Use my location" button + nearest-city readout (no external geocoding; coordinates only).
- **This round — Life Trajectory** (`core/trajectory.js` + `pages/trajectory.html`): a birth chart
  for **anywhere by lat/lon** (or "use my location") read across a life — natal signatures, the
  year-by-year **profection timeline & Lord of the Year**, **primary directions**, the **solar
  return**, and a **personalised Picatrix layer** (ruling planets → works the tradition counts as
  the chart's; the year's significations; how the election rules score the sky now; the
  highest-scoring talisman). **Shareable via URL** (`history.replaceState` round-trips the birth
  data) and **printable** (new `@media print` stylesheet).
- Headless tests extended (trajectory + location); adversarial review run; all confirmed findings
  fixed (framing → historical voice; temperament citation hedged; talisman pick scores all
  affinities; page linked from nav/footer/Tools hub).

## ▶ REMAINING — step by step

### Phase 3 finish — organize / link / share / export
1. **SVG/PNG export** of the chart wheel — `XMLSerializer` for SVG, `canvas.toDataURL` for PNG;
   a "Download chart" button on the wheel in horary / master / trajectory / now. *(not started)*
2. **Generalise save/share** — lift the trajectory page's URL round-trip into a shared
   `encodeState/decodeState` helper and add a "Copy link" control to master / election / now.
   *(trajectory done; others pending)*
3. **A11y pass** — `role`/`aria-label` on the chrome injected by `shared.js`, alt/aria on glyph
   imagery, keyboard nav, contrast check; extend `verify-site` to assert landmarks. *(not started)*
4. **Print CSS** — ✅ done this round (recipe cards, readings). Sweep remaining pages for print
   clutter.
5. **Glossary/hover-card completeness** — confirm every Picatrix/election/natal term auto-links.

### Phase 4 — live worked examples *(not started)*
6. Reusable `app/example.js` that casts a real chart and renders engine output inline.
7. Convert `pages/book2/examples.html` (Ship at Sea, Stolen Fish, Marriage) from static prose to
   **recomputed, annotated** figures; verify against Lilly's printed positions within tolerance.
8. A live Picatrix election worked example driven by the engine (the talisman page's worked
   example already recomputes live — extend the pattern).

### Accuracy finishing *(open)*
9. `accuracy-check` the flagged pitted/azimene/fortune degrees in `data/degree-tables.js`; fill the
   4 blank fortune-degree signs; record provenance in-data.
10. Add Picatrix I.4 per-mansion talismanic images to `data/lunar-mansions.js` (uses present;
    images pending).

## Honest status
The literature, tools, talisman track, the **location feature**, and the **life-trajectory
feature** are built and verified. What remains is **Phase 3 polish** (export, generalised
share, a11y), **Phase 4 live examples**, and **accuracy finishing** — all additive and gated by
`verify-site`. The astronomy/engine layer is complete; the remaining work is presentation,
shareability, and sourcing rather than new computation.

## Round log — rename, home page, chart-health, critique fixes (2026-06-25, later)
**Shipped this round** (Ultracode workflow: 4 critics → 30 prioritized findings + 16 explainers):
- **Renamed** the site to **The Astrologer's Workbench** (brand, footer, all page titles).
- **New home page** — explains and links every feature (live & personal, the three books, Picatrix,
  learn/tools/workflow), honest note now includes the magic layer, and the two "Master" tools are disambiguated.
- **`pages/how-it-works.html`** — all 16 calculations with meaning + step-by-step (as the engine runs them) +
  a worked example + citation; linked from home, footer and Tools hub.
- **Chart health → next auspicious time**: `election.nextAuspiciousTime()` scans forward for the next clearer
  hour; wired into the Book I master panel and Right Now (on-demand).
- **Verdict colours explained**: `VERDICT_LEGEND` (green/amber/red = a gravity scale, **not** the planetary/
  talisman colours; a crude impediment count, not a substitute for weighing significators) on now/master/book1,
  + a Glossary entry.
- **Real bug fixed**: nav active-state used substring matching (lit up 6 items); now exact per-section + a11y skip link.
- **Lilly/Picatrix/honesty fixes**: under-beams copy 12°→17°; Part-of-Fortune day/night flagged as a contested fork;
  election reframed as *ranks, not a hard elector*; talisman gains the **suffumigation+petition consecration step**,
  the decan-face vs planetary-image distinction, and a relevant-only Behenian star; the "three spirit systems" claim
  corrected to two-represented-of-three (Mirror angels flagged as not-yet-included); Mercury operation keywords fixed;
  operation→planet mapping flagged editorial.

**Still open (from the 30 findings — lower priority):** sect-aware Part-of-Fortune toggle; weight chart-health by the
actual significators; gating filters in the elector (never green over a combust/retrograde ruler); mansion malefic
weighting & non-substring mansion match; mobile nav collapse; add the Picatrix Mirror-angel data; per-tool inline
"how it's calculated" links (centralised page done); Phase 4 live worked examples for Lilly's charts; SVG/PNG export;
generalised URL-share across all tools.

## Round log — the unified Workbench + a local-LLM bridge (2026-06-25, later)
**Shipped this round** (see `WORKBENCH.md` for the full results & design):
- **`core/reading.js`** — `fullReading(chart, opts)`: ONE pure function composing the union of every computation
  (figure · dignity ledger · aspects/reception · lots/antiscia · chart health · horary perfection · election ·
  talisman · life-trajectory) into one serializable, cited object. The single source of truth for the UI, the JSON
  export and the LLM. Exports the canonical `HONEST_FRAMING`.
- **`core/registry.js`** — the capability catalogue (21 entries); an anti-drift engine-test asserts every export, page,
  how-it-works anchor and glossary term it names actually exists, so the map can't rot.
- **`core/llm-context.js`** — `buildContext()` (locked honest-framing system prompt + cited facts), `buildToolSchema()`,
  `runTool()` (safe engine dispatcher).
- **`app/state.js`** — generalised share/export (`encodeState/decodeState`, URL round-trip, `downloadJSON`,
  SVG/PNG chart export — closes the long-open backlog item).
- **`pages/workbench.html` + `app/workbench.js`** — THE unified tool; every panel registry-linked; JSON/SVG/PNG export;
  shareable URL; wired into nav/footer/Tools hub and linked from `master.html` as its superset.
- **`app/assistant.js` + `docs/LOCAL-LLM.html`** — "Ask a local model" (Ollama / in-browser WebLLM; Explain + Tools
  modes). Makes NO network call on load (keeps the browser gate green); honest framing locked in the system prompt.
- **Verified:** audit `Problems: 0`; engine-test `all passed` (incl. reading/registry/llm-context blocks); real-browser
  sweep **34 pages, 0 errors**; a content assertion confirms every Workbench panel renders; an end-to-end assistant test
  against a mock Ollama confirms detect → streamed reply → a Tools-mode tool-call executing the **real** engine.
- **Environment:** Node 26 via a conda env (`astro-workbench`); the `verify-site` gate runs on Windows.
