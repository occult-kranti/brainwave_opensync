**Coverage audit + phased roadmap. Authoritative master plan, refreshed 2026-06-25.**

This is the project's spine document. It supersedes the original vision plan (preserved in git
history) with a **verified** coverage audit — every status below was checked against the actual
code in `assets/js/core/` and the pages in `pages/`, not just prior docs. It pairs with
`COVERAGE.md` (the short audit), `REVIEW.md` (the critical + mathematician's-lens review),
`MASTER-PLAN-V2.md` (the round-by-round build log), `HANDOFF.md` (environment + ship), and
`research/SOURCE-DATA.md` (the cited data).

> **Honest framing (load-bearing, non-negotiable).** Astrology has no demonstrated predictive
> validity and is classified as a pseudoscience. This project reconstructs Lilly's *Christian
> Astrology* (1647), the *Picatrix*, and Jyotiṣa as **historical formal systems** — described,
> never prescribed. The **astronomy is real and verifiable**; the **interpretations are the
> tradition's**, offered for study. "Coverage" below means **fidelity to the historical texts'
> own techniques**, never predictive accuracy. The canonical disclaimer lives in
> `core/reading.js` (`HONEST_FRAMING`) and is locked into the LLM system prompt.

> **The registry is the spine of "what exists."** `assets/js/core/registry.js` catalogues 21
> capabilities, each naming the module, export, citation, surfacing page, how-it-works anchor,
> and glossary terms. An anti-drift test in `scripts/engine-test.mjs` asserts every referenced
> export/page/anchor/term actually resolves — so the map cannot silently rot. This audit uses it
> as the index and verifies each entry against the implementation.

## Status at a glance

The computational heart is **built and verified**: Lilly Books I–III, Picatrix I–III (the
computable parts), the Lilly↔Picatrix election/talisman bridge, a whole-life trajectory, a
unified `fullReading` spine, a capability registry, a Claude-powered grounded assistant, and a
**second independent system** (Jyotiṣa / Jagannath Hora). Verified each round via `verify-site`
(audit `Problems: 0`; engine-test `all passed`; real-Chromium sweep of 35 pages, 0 console errors).

**What genuinely remains** (see the **NEXT STEPS** roadmap below) is not core astronomy — it is
**(1)** two fidelity refinements: *significator-weighted chart health* and the *seven Hermetic Lots +
sect-aware Part of Fortune* (which also feeds the new natal-topic reader); **(2)** the proposed
mathematician's-lens **explainers** (falsification demo, structure/patterns, election heat-map);
**(3)** Lilly/Picatrix polish (election gating, antiscia-in-judgement, accuracy degrees, glossary
completion); and **(4)** the quality sweep (a full **a11y** audit, navigation finish, export/share,
final QA). *(The Lilly-depth pedagogy — **live worked charts**, **house-by-house judgement**, **natal
topic readers**, **rectification** (gaps #3/#4/#19/#20) — was **shipped 2026-06-30, Phase R5**; the
**six-fold Ṣaḍbala**, **Vedic glossary + remedies**, **Picatrix images** and **mobile-nav collapse**
were shipped earlier. See the round notes.)*

### Shipped this round — "Phase R2", 2026-06-25 *(verified: audit 0 · engine-test all passed · 35-page Chromium sweep 0 errors)*
A user-driven round that completed several roadmap gaps and deepened the assistant + the second system:
- **Full six-fold Ṣaḍbala** (gap #7) — `vedic.js` `shadbala()` now computes Sthāna, Dig, Kāla, Ceṣṭā,
  Naisargika and Dṛk bala in **virūpas**, with required minimums, ratios, and Iṣṭa/Kaṣṭa phala (BPHS Ch. 27;
  documented JHora simplifications flagged). Rendered as a table on every Vedic panel.
- **Vedic glossary** (gap #8) — 20 Jyotiṣa terms (Sidereal Zodiac, Ayanāṁśa, Lagna, Graha, Nakṣatra,
  Vimśottarī Daśā, Pañcāṅga, Varga, Navāṁśa, Aṣṭakavarga, Ṣaḍbala, Bhāva, Kāraka, Bīja Mantra, Yantra…)
  in `data/glossary.js`, auto-linked and wired into the registry's `vedic` entry.
- **Vedic daily/birth remedies** (gap #9) — `data/vedic-remedies.js` (navagraha bīja+nāma mantras & japa,
  vāra observances, nakṣatra devatās, graha→yantra/gem, and a **modern-flagged** graha→āsana map), composed
  by `vedic.js` `buildPractice()` into `castVedic().practice`. The *selection* is algorithmic — the day's
  vāra lord, the **weakest graha by Ṣaḍbala**, the Lagna lord, the daśā lord and the Moon nakṣatra drive it —
  never hardcoded. Described, never prescribed; the āsana map is loudly labelled modern syncretism.
- **Mobile nav collapse** (gap #16, partial) — the 14-item bar now collapses behind an accessible hamburger
  below 880 px (`shared.js` + `style.css`); breadcrumbs/≤2-click reachability remain.
- **Deeper Claude assistant** (beyond the roadmap) — the Codex now embeds the **whole** computed reading
  (both systems + the daily/birth practice) and asks for a cross-system **Concordance** (pattern-finding,
  agree/disagree between tropical & sidereal); the agentic flow gained `castVedic`/`vedicPractice` tools so a
  custom prompt computes via the **in-browser engine** instead of browsing the site; richer Vedic facts in
  `buildContext`.
- **Unified Master birth moment** — `master.html` gained an optional birth-moment block (+ a prominent
  📍 use-my-location button), so Book III and the Vedic chart read from an **actual birth**.
- **Save & publish** — the Workbench silently auto-saves each reading's inputs to `localStorage`, exports a
  **Markdown** summary, and can publish a reading to a **secret GitHub Gist** with the user's own token
  (the honest browser path to "send it to GitHub" — a static site has no backend).
- **Workbench superset** — added the Picatrix moment-correspondences (mansion / decan faces / Behenian stars)
  it previously lacked, so it is now a true superset of the Master tool.

### Shipped this round — "Phase R3", 2026-06-25 *(verified: audit 0 · engine-test all passed · 36-page Chromium sweep 0 errors)*
A consolidation + integration round:
- **One master tool.** The redundant "Unified Master Tool" (`master-unified.js`) is folded into **the Workbench**, which
  is now *the* master tool. `pages/master.html` is a redirect; nav collapses to a single **Master Tool** entry (now 13
  items); all home/tools/footer/page links retargeted. The book-scoped Book I & III calculators remain (clearly book-scoped).
- **Workbench reorganised.** The **🕉 Vedic toggle moved to the top** (right after the figure); **horary moved up** and the
  "question about house" field removed from the form — the horary card now shows the **general** querent+Moon state by default,
  with an **in-card house picker** for a specific quesited.
- **Vedic conclusions & advice** (gap toward #19 in spirit) — `vedic.js` `buildVedicConclusions()` adds a COMPUTED,
  deterministic interpretive layer (Lagna & lord, strongest/weakest graha, the running daśā, supported/strained bhāvas by
  Aṣṭakavarga, yogas, the Moon's nakṣatra, and a synthesised conclusion + caveat). Rendered on every Vedic panel & the JSON.
- **Picatrix Book III & IV** (gaps #11 + #21) — new `data/picatrix-prayers.js`: the seven planetary **prayers** (III.7), the
  **directional spirits** of the Liber Antimaquis (III.9 — the third spirit system, kept distinct), the **Perfect Nature**
  (III.6), and a **Book IV** summary (toxic/animal/poison items flagged HISTORICAL-ONLY). New page `picatrix/prayers.html`;
  the ruling planet of a talisman links to its prayer; a `picatrixPrayer` tool lets the assistant recite/explain it;
  3 glossary terms + a registry entry. Greer–Warnock translation, cross-checked.
- **Assistant prompts redesigned** — data-first: the **whole computed reading is sent as JSON** in the prompt. Two presets
  (🔎 *Interpret & advise — everything together*, a plain cross-system synthesis; 📜 *Codex*, evocative) **plus** the custom
  "plan a working" box; **every reply has a ⤓ save** (raw → Markdown). The Vedic & prayer tools are available to the agentic loop.
- **Save simplified** — the GitHub-Gist publish was removed (messy); the report is **downloaded** (JSON/Markdown) and
  auto-saved on-device.

### Shipped this round — "Phase R4", 2026-06-25 *(verified: audit 0 · engine-test all passed · Chromium sweep 0 errors)*
A teaching, interpretation & coverage round (with an independent UX review — see `REVIEW-R4.md`):
- **The on-ramp** (the review's #1 gap) — new **`pages/basics.html`** explains *every concept* (Western + Picatrix +
  Vedic) in plain English with no maths, featured first in the home "Start here" and the nav; new
  **`pages/interpret.html`** is a panel-by-panel "how to read your results" guide. Every concept now has a basics
  entry + a glossary definition.
- **Picatrix images completed** — **per-mansion talismanic images** (gap #5, `data/mansion-images.js`, 28, Agrippa
  II.46 + Picatrix IV.9 — shown on the Mansions page & by the Moon's mansion in the Master Tool) and the
  **per-planet planetary-image set** (gap #12, `data/planet-images.js`, 7, Agrippa II.38–44 — shown for the ruling
  planet in the talisman panel). Single-witness/divergent records and toxic/animal materials flagged.
- **UX fixes** (from the review): the AI conversation text is now **white** on the dark log; **wide tables scroll** on
  mobile; the **assistant model labels** were reconciled and Fable **refusals are handled gracefully**; honest-note
  callouts added to the **glossary** and the **Book I hub**.
- The remaining UX backlog (jargon autolink on dynamic panels, election auto-run, nav grouping, a11y pass) is tracked
  in `REVIEW-R4.md` and the gap list below.

### Shipped this round — "Phase R5", 2026-06-30 *(verified: audit 0 · engine-test all passed (77 registry exports) · Chromium sweep 38 pages 0 errors)*
The Lilly-depth round (the headline pedagogy gap) + the UX backlog (researched by a 6-agent workflow — see `REVIEW-R5.md`):
- **Live Lilly worked charts** — Lilly's OWN horary figures (the stolen fish, the ship at sea, the marriage, the lost
  dog) are now read **live** from the positions he printed in the 1647 woodcuts: `core/chart-from-positions.js` feeds
  the printed figure into the engine, `data/worked-charts.js` holds the sourced positions (with per-planet confidence
  & honest caveats), and `pages/book2/examples.html` draws each wheel, scores every dignity and runs the judgement
  **beside Lilly's words and the recorded outcome**. (The common "Venus in Libra = the dog" retelling was corrected: the
  dog is **Mercury**, lord of the 6th.)
- **House-by-house horary judgement** — `core/horary-judge.js` (`horaryJudgement`) identifies the significators, runs
  the modes of perfection, reads the Moon, and reduces to an affirmed/qualified/denied tone with the cited Book II rule
  (sickness/death/prison read in the inverted sense, contests by the stronger significator). `data/horary-house-judgement.js`
  is the reference layer; `pages/book2/houses.html` gains a **live judgement reader** + the 12 houses with their
  natural significators, perfection-meaning and affirm/deny testimonies.
- **Book III natal-topic readers + rectification** — `core/natal-topics.js` reads each of the 12 Book III topics from
  three testimonies into a tone; `core/rectification.js` adds the **Animodar** (Ptolemy) and **Trutine of Hermes**
  (both contested, every assumption surfaced; the Animodar/Trutine reuse the hyleg engine's pre-natal syzygy). Both are
  surfaced on `pages/book3/master.html`.
- **UX backlog cleared** — the **Claude chat** is redesigned into readable, high-contrast labelled bubbles (You = gold,
  Claude = slate, pre-wrap body); **jargon autolinks** now reach dynamically-rendered result panels (workbench, horary,
  Book III master, worked charts); the **nav is grouped** Start • Tools • Books • Reference (faint dividers on desktop,
  labelled sections on mobile); the **election tool** re-judges live on aim/house-system change; and an **a11y pass**
  added a global `:focus-visible` ring, `aria-hidden` on decorative glyphs, responsive coordinate inputs, and table
  `<caption>` on the worked-charts ledger. (A full automated a11y audit is still open — its workflow agent hit a spend
  limit; tracked in `REVIEW-R5.md`.)
- Registry gains `horary-judgement`, `worked-charts`, `chart-from-positions`, `natal-topics`, `rectification`; glossary
  gains Significator, Rectification, Animodar, Trutine of Hermes.

## NEXT STEPS — the post-R5 roadmap *(planned 2026-06-30; **R6–R9 all shipped 2026-06-30**)*

✅ **ALL FOUR PHASES SHIPPED (2026-06-30)** — see the round notes below; verified each wave at the `verify-site`
gate (audit 0 · engine-test all passed · Chromium sweep 40 pages 0 errors, now with **a11y landmark assertions**)
and pushed to `origin/main` (R6 `e5637a3`, R7 `d9f1d47`, R8 `b2b0b53`, R9 this commit). The plan below is kept for
the record with each phase marked done.

R5 closed the Lilly-depth pedagogy (worked charts, house-by-house judgement, natal topics, rectification — gaps
#3, #4, #19, #20) and cleared most of the UX backlog (chat redesign, autolink-on-dynamic, nav grouping, election
live-update, a partial a11y pass). What remained, in **priority order**:

### Phase R6 — Fidelity & the Lots ✅ **DONE** *(+ personalization & "here-and-now")*
- **R6-1 · Significator-weighted chart health** — gap #1. Weight each caution by whether it touches the
  querent/quesited (or natal) significators, instead of a flat severity count. The single most-cited fidelity
  defect; the flat count is alien to Lilly's method. `core/cautions.js` → flows into every verdict badge.
- **R6-2 · The seven Hermetic Lots + sect-aware Part of Fortune toggle** — gap #2. New `core/lots.js` (Fortune,
  Spirit, Eros, Necessity, Victory, Courage, Nemesis — *plus* the topic Lots of Marriage / Children / Father that
  the **R5 natal-topics reader already names but does not yet compute**), a sect toggle, and `reading.lots`
  exposing them all. Directly upgrades the R5 reader and underpins Phase R7.

### Phase R7 — The honest-science explainers ✅ **DONE** *(the locked framing, made interactive)*
- **R7-1 · Falsification demo** — gap #14. `pages/experiment.html`: permute the birth time N× through
  `fullReading`, plot the verdict/dignity **null distribution** in-tool. The strongest honesty feature —
  mathematically and rhetorically clean, and core to the non-negotiable framing.
- **R7-2 · Structure / Patterns explorer** — gap #13. `pages/structure.html`: the modular-week theorem, antiscia
  reflection and aspect harmonics as one teaching view of the system's hidden symmetry.
- **R7-3 · Election heat-map** — gap #15. A 7-day × 24-hour `rankNow` grid on the election page; the weekly
  planetary-hour periodicity emerges visually. Cheap; reuses `electionScore`.

### Phase R8 — Lilly / Picatrix polish & accuracy ✅ **DONE** *(+ fixed the swapped antiscion labels)*
- **R8-1 · Election gating polish** — gap #6. Curated mansion-fitness keyword map (replace the naive substring),
  down-weight malefic mansions — removes a known false-positive path in the elector.
- **R8-2 · Antiscia woven into judgement** — gap #17. Treat antiscia/contra-antiscia as hidden contacts in the
  perfection/aspect search (Lilly judges by them; currently display-only).
- **R8-3 · Accuracy finishing** — gap #23. `accuracy-check` the pitted/azimene/fortune degrees; fill the 4 blank
  fortune signs (Taurus/Leo/Sagittarius/Capricorn); record provenance in-data.
- **R8-4 · Glossary completion** — gap #10. The remaining Western/Picatrix terms (Election, Profection,
  Suffumigation, Behenian, Perfect Nature, the two spirit systems).
- *(Optional)* Decumbiture mode (gap #18); magic squares / kāmeas, clearly flagged Agrippa (gap #22).

### Phase R9 — Quality & ship ✅ **DONE**
- **R9-1 · Complete the a11y pass** — gap #25. Finish what the R5 audit agent could not (it hit a spend limit):
  table `scope`/`caption` across **all** data tables, an `aria-live` review of every live region, a contrast
  audit, and extend the verify gate to assert landmarks/labels.
- **R9-2 · Navigation finish** — gap #16. Breadcrumbs, every page ≤2 clicks, un-dead-end `correspondences.html`.
- **R9-3 · Export / share sweep** — gap #24. SVG/PNG export + URL-share across **all** tools (mostly done in the
  Workbench/`state.js`; sweep the rest).
- **R9-4 · Final QA** — spot-check ~10 numbers vs external references; refresh `README.md` / `COVERAGE.md` / this
  plan; ship.

### Deliberately out of scope *(unless explicitly promoted)*
- Rigorous **Placidian mundane** primary directions (semi-arc) — the Naibod approximation stays, self-flagged.
- The **Picatrix Book IV** full per-sign liturgies & incense recipes — framing-sensitive, kept summary-only.

**Dependency:** R6-2 (Lots) underpins both the R5 natal-topics reader and the R7 explainers — do it before R7.

---

## FURTHER ROADMAP — AI integration & the next oracle *(planned 2026-06-30, after a 3-agent research workflow)*

### AI integration — provider-agnostic ✅ **SHIPPED**, then deepen
- ✅ **Provider-agnostic assistant** — `app/assistant.js` now supports **Claude** (recommended, agentic tools) **and
  OpenAI-compatible** backends so users can bring a **free-tier** key: **Groq, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Cerebras,
  Mistral** (all five **verified browser-direct CORS** by the research, with current 2026 model IDs) + a custom base
  URL. Streaming `/chat/completions` parsing; the grounded honest-framing system prompt flows through both paths;
  tools stay Claude-only. **Tested end-to-end against a local mock OpenAI server** (no account): no network on load,
  the grounded prompt reaches the provider, the reply streams into a bubble. *(No key is ever bundled — embedding one
  in a public static repo would be scraped/abused; free tiers are rate-limited and need a personal signup. BYOK is the
  right pattern.)*
### Deepen the AI — ✅ **SHIPPED** (the diviner), then continue
- ✅ **Shared transport** — extracted `app/llm-core.js` (the provider table + the live-tested Anthropic & OpenAI-compatible
  streaming + the agentic Claude tool-loop), and refactored `app/assistant.js` onto it (behaviour-preserving). Both the
  Workbench assistant and the new **divination assistant** (`app/divination-assistant.js`) now share ONE transport.
- ✅ **Expert-diviner persona + grounding** — `core/llm-context.js` gained `DIVINER_PREAMBLE` (a learned-historian voice,
  layered on the LOCKED `HONEST_FRAMING`) and `buildGeomancyContext` / `buildTarotContext` + interpret-prompt & data-block
  builders, so the AI narrates the **computed, cited** cast and never invents figures/cards. **Free-tier-aware** context
  (Groq 8000 TPM): a leaner fact/glossary budget and no JSON data block for OpenAI-compatible keys. **Live-tested on the
  real Groq free tier** (geomancy + tarot interpret): HTTP 200, grounded replies, 0 console errors.
- ✅ **Per-panel "✶ Explain this"** — every geomancy shield-figure / house and every dealt tarot card carries an explain
  chip that pre-fills a focused, grounded question into the diviner chat.
- ✅ **Per-panel "✶ explain this" on the Workbench** — every result panel (figure, horary, dignities, aspects, lots,
  cautions, election, talisman, natal) carries a chip that pre-fills a scoped, grounded question into the assistant
  (the chip only NAMES the panel; the values come from the grounded context, so nothing can be misquoted).
- ✅ **The AI can cast the oracles** — `castGeomancy` / `drawTarot` / `castIChing` are engine tools (Claude agentic
  mode): the randomness is injected by the APP layer (`ctx.rand`, crypto) — never chosen by the model, never generated
  in the pure core — or reproduced from explicit tallies/throws; every tool result carries the honest framing.
- ⬜ **Still to deepen:** a cite-bound output contract (`[F#]` fact tags); a glossary-aware `defineTerm` tool + inline
  term links; a structured talisman walk-through renderer; streaming-markdown rendering with copy/regenerate.

### Geomancy — ✅ **SHIPPED** *(the research's top pick: heavy occult usage × excellent engine fit)*
Western/Arabic **geomancy** (ʿilm al-raml) — Agrippa's "daughter of astrology": four random Mothers → the **Shield**
(Daughters by transposition, Nieces, two Witnesses, the **Judge** — always an even figure, the built-in checksum — and
the Reconciler) and the **House Chart** judged horary-style. Almost entirely computable: the whole Shield is boolean
algebra; only the final narrative is interpretive.
- **DATA** `core/data/geomantic-figures.js` — the 16 figures as a **provably-complete, distinct bijection** of the 2⁴
  dot-patterns (derived by exhaustive elimination — the 4 palindromes, the 6 reverse-pairs, the planetary rulers and the
  even/odd parity — after both research agents *and* a web transcription each introduced duplicate patterns; cited Agrippa
  II.48–53 + Greer).
- **CORE** `core/geomancy.js` (PURE, no RNG) — `addFigures` (row-wise parity), `mothersFromTallies`, `castShield`,
  `geomancyHouses`, `geomanticJudgement` (the four modes of perfection → an affirmed/qualified/denied tone). The cast's
  randomness lives only in `app/geomancy.js` (crypto RNG, or strike the marks by hand).
- **PAGE** `pages/geomancy.html` + `app/geomancy.js` (the Shield in tiers, the 12-house chart, the judgement, the diviner
  panel, the 16-figure reference). Registered in `registry.js`; `engine-test.mjs` asserts the 16-figure bijection, the
  parity rule, and the **Judge-is-always-even theorem over 500 casts**.

### Tarot — ✅ **SHIPPED** *(the strong follow-on: very-high usage, good fit via the Golden Dawn correspondences)*
The **78-card** Rider–Waite–Smith / Golden Dawn deck.
- **DATA** `core/data/tarot-deck.js` — 22 Major (with the GD Hebrew-letter & astrological attributions) + 56 Minor (four
  suits × Ace–Ten + 4 courts), each with a normalised element, upright/reversed keywords and a Waite-register meaning
  (generated from a verified research table; cited Waite 1911 + Book T).
- **CORE** `core/tarot.js` (PURE, no RNG) — the canonical spreads (single, Past/Present/Future, Horseshoe, the 10-card
  **Celtic Cross**) with positioned cards, the Golden Dawn **elemental dignities**, and a balance summary. The shuffle/draw
  lives only in `app/tarot.js` (crypto RNG, optional reversals).
- **PAGE** `pages/tarot.html` + `app/tarot.js` (a laid-out board, per-position reading, dignities, the diviner panel, the
  78-card reference). Registered in `registry.js`; `engine-test.mjs` asserts the 78 distinct cards, 14-per-suit, the
  dignity rules, and the Celtic Cross.
### I Ching — ✅ **SHIPPED** *(the third divination oracle: the Book of Changes)*
The **Yijing** — a hexagram cast at the moment of asking.
- **DATA** `core/data/iching-hexagrams.js` — the 8 trigrams + the 64 hexagrams in the **King Wen sequence** (name, pinyin,
  the six lines bottom→top, Judgment, Image, six changing-line texts, keywords), generated from a research/verify workflow.
  Line texts are **original paraphrases after James Legge** (SBE XVI, 1899, public domain), NOT the copyrighted
  Wilhelm–Baynes. The 64 line-patterns are a verified complete, distinct bijection.
- **CORE** `core/iching.js` (PURE, no RNG) — `linesFromThrows` (the 6/7/8/9 three-coin mapping), `castReading` (primary +
  moving lines + **nuclear** inner hexagram + **relating** hexagram by flipping the moving lines). The coin toss lives in
  `app/iching.js` (crypto RNG, or set the lines by hand).
- **PAGE** `pages/iching.html` + `app/iching.js` (the hexagram lines drawn primary→relating, the reading, the diviner
  panel, the 8-trigram + 64-hexagram reference). Registered in `registry.js`; `engine-test.mjs` asserts the 64-hexagram
  bijection, the 6/7/8/9 mapping, relating/nuclear correctness, and that **every hexagram's derived trigrams match its
  named lower/upper** (a cross-check that caught a swapped-trigram data bug, found live).

### AI — provider trim ✅ **SHIPPED**
The assistant now offers **only Claude + Groq**, with **Groq the default** (`llm-core.js` `PROVIDERS`/`PROV_ORDER`). A
git-skipped **`app/local-config.js`** (committed EMPTY — no secret) lets the maintainer pre-fill their own key as the
default on their own device (`git update-index --skip-worktree`) without ever exposing it in the public repo.

### R11 — Organise & integrate ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-01)
A whole-site organisation + cross-feature integration pass:
- **Navigation & indexes** — an **Oracles** entry in the main nav (→ `tools.html#divination`); the Master Index
  (`contents.html`) completed with Picatrix, Vedic, Oracles and AI-assistant cards (it had only the three Books +
  Reference); the Picatrix hub cross-links "the daughters of astrology"; the live **Now** dashboard links "cast an
  oracle at this hour".
- **"The hour of the cast"** (`app/cast-hour.js`) — the oracle pages now surface the astrology engine's own timing
  lore: the planetary day & hour, the Moon's sign/phase/mansion, void-of-course and Via-Combusta flags — the tradition's
  practice (geomancers cast in the hour of the matter; Lilly warns against judging under a void Moon), shown for study.
- **AI integration** (see the Deepen list above): per-panel explain chips on the Workbench; the three oracle tools.
- **Copy refresh** — "ask Claude (Anthropic API)" → "the AI assistant (Groq free tier or Claude)" across
  workbench/tools/docs; the assistant panels no longer advertise removed providers; `docs/LOCAL-LLM.html` rewritten for
  the two-backend reality + the diviner.

### R12 — The Jung wing ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-07)
A complete study wing + tool for C. G. Jung's actual astrological practice, from a 6-agent deep-research workflow
(web-verified against the primary texts: CW paragraph numbers, the Freud/Jung letters verbatim, the experiment's
figures from CW 8 §§872–915 + appendix):
- **DATA** `core/data/jung-astrology.js` — the 7 planetary archetypes (Jung vs post-Jungian flagged per record), the
  element→function mapping (honestly credited to Arroyo 1975/Greene 1977), the VERIFIED marriage-experiment record
  (batches 180/220/83 = 483 pairs; orb 8°; the 32,220-pair control at 5.3%; the Fierz-correction story; Frey-Rohn),
  the Aion aeon datings (Jung's own: "between AD 2000 and AD 2200", n. to §149), Jung's nativity (Baumann-Jung 1975,
  flagged as a family reconstruction), and a 23-entry cited timeline (1875 → Tarnas 2006).
- **ENGINE** `core/jung.js` (PURE) — `jungianReading` (archetypes, function balance, coniunctio, anima/animus, senex);
  `crossAspects`/`jungAspectHits` (the experiment's grid: conj/opp of Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Asc–Desc per CW 8 §878);
  `experimentBatch`/`expectedRate` (the honest null model — injected rand); `aeonClock` (Platonic month ≈2148 yr,
  Lahiri Aquarius ≈ AD 2440). Engine-test reproduces Jung's own chart (Sun 3° Leo, Moon 15° Taurus, Asc early
  Aquarius — his famous Sol–Luna square detected).
- **PAGES** `pages/jung/` — index (hub), timeline (rendered from the cited data module), theory (8 sections, CW-cited),
  experiment (the real figures + a live 200-batch Monte-Carlo showing chance produces his ~10% maxima), sources (the
  full bibliography incl. Rossi & Le Grice 2017), tool.
- **TOOL** `app/jung-tool.js` + `pages/jung/tool.html` — the psychological horoscope (wheel + archetype table +
  typology + coniunctio + shadow; one click loads Jung's own nativity), the marriage-experiment synastry grid with the
  three classic aspects flagged and the honest chance-rate callout, and the aeon clock.
- **AI** — "Let Jung read it himself": a first-person C. G. Jung persona (`JUNG_PREAMBLE`, layered ON the locked honest
  framing — explicitly a historical reconstruction, never prediction/diagnosis) with a STEP-BY-STEP CODEBOOK interpret
  prompt (`buildJungInterpretPrompt`: numbered steps 0–10 — the frame, Sol, Luna, the coniunctio, Mercurius,
  Venus/Mars, Jupiter/Saturn, the four functions, the individuation synthesis, the honest word), grounded in the
  computed report via `buildJungContext`/`jungDataBlock`, wired through the shared divination assistant (Claude
  recommended at 8192 tokens; free Groq fits at 4096). Live-tested on Groq: in-character, grounded, 0 errors.
- Wired: nav "Jung" (Books group), tools hub (2 cards), Master Index card, About-page science item + sources line,
  10 glossary terms, registry entry, engine-test asserts.

### R13 — Kameas & sigils + cite-bound AI + oracle share/export ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-07)
- **Kameas** (`core/data/kameas.js` + `core/kamea.js` + `app/kamea.js` + `pages/picatrix/kameas.html`): the seven
  planetary magic squares exactly as Agrippa prints them (II.22), from a research workflow whose grids were verified
  cell-for-cell against the 1651 printing AND re-proven arithmetically three independent times (the workflow's verifier,
  the generator script, and `validateKamea` in the engine-test + live on the page). Intelligence/spirit names with
  independently-computed gematria (the 1651 "Kedemel 157" misprint and the Moon's corrupt printed Hebrew flagged
  in-record, not silently fixed); engraving metals & Agrippa's recorded uses; and a **sigil tracer** — any name drawn on
  the square by the aiq-bekar method (III.30), start-circle, end-bar, repeat-wave, with Latin letter-values honestly
  flagged as a modern convenience. The cast-hour strip ties it to the Election Engine (links now root-based, fixed for
  any page depth).
- **Cite-bound AI output** — every grounded system prompt (Workbench + all diviners + Jung) now numbers its facts
  `[F1..]` and carries an OUTPUT CONTRACT requiring computed claims to be tagged; the fact previews show the numbers.
- **Oracle share & export** — geomancy/tarot/iching casts travel in the URL (mothers / exact draws / line-throws) and
  restore deterministically; every oracle page gains "Copy shareable link" + "Download reading (MD)".

### R14 — Plain-words AI over everything + the golden example case ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-08)
- **🗣 Plain words** — a new one-click, CODEBOOKED reading on the Workbench assistant that walks EVERY computed panel
  (figure/hour, dignities, chart health, aspects, lots, election, talisman, + horary/natal/vedic when present) in a
  fixed five-part structure per step: **In plain words** (jargon translated), **The good**, **The hard**, **Concerns**,
  **To reflect on** (a mirror/question — never advice, prediction or a claim about the person). The honest frame is
  step 0, FIRST, so free-tier truncation can never lose it; replies are cite-bound ([F#]). The same five-part
  **plain-words coda** now ends every oracle interpret (geomancy/tarot/iching) and the Jung reading (`PLAIN_CODA`).
- **`defineTerm`** — a glossary tool for the agentic mode: the model can look any term up so its definitions match the
  site exactly (fuzzy, top-5).
- **Free-tier budget hardening** — `buildContext` gained `maxGlossary`; the one-click flows drop the JSON digest and
  cap output at 3072 tokens on free providers (the numbered facts already ground them); the Workbench assistant got
  the same assistant-first-history fix and history-truncation the diviner review mandated.
- **THE GOLDEN EXAMPLE CASE** — one fixed, externally-verifiable scenario through the ENTIRE pipeline, asserted on
  every test run and documented on the About page with a one-click reproduction link: J2000 (2000-01-01 12:00 UT) at
  London + Jung's published nativity + a 7th-house question. Externals: Sun 280.37° (10°22′ Capricorn — textbook),
  Lahiri ayanāṁśa 23.853°, Jung's Leo/Taurus/Aquarius figures; internals: age 124 → 5th-house profection, SAV 337,
  every block composed, JSON round-trip, the 12-step plain-words codebook. Live E2E (real Chromium + real Groq):
  the share-link computes the case, the plain-words reply arrives with the honest frame first, all five labels,
  [F#] tags, zero console errors.

### R15–R18 — The Hermetic Chronology merger & the historical-calculation layer ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-12)
*(planned & built after a 10-agent research workflow: 2 inventory + 4 web-research + 4 adversarial verifiers; every
load-bearing numeric claim cross-checked against primary sources AND recomputed with our own engine. Verified:
engine-test all passed · audit 0 · Chromium 58 pages 0 errors · cast-link E2E chronology→workbench ALL PASS.
Also shipped: the **🎯 Auspicious moment** one-click on the Workbench assistant — the ENGINE scans 72 h ahead with
findNextElection (deterministic, 30-min steps) and the model translates each found window through a codebooked
walk, book meaning → literal real-life terms, honest frame first, five-part plain-words coda.)*

**The second tool.** `occult-kranti/hermetic-timeline` — "The Hermetic Chronology" — is a 7-page static sourced
timeline of Hermetic philosophy/magic/occult (Babylon → the academy), 43 entries in 8 eras, each carrying an
epistemic label (*documented / disputed / debunked / conspiracy*), plus alchemy / rituals / hermetica / field-guide /
library companion pages. Same honest-framing philosophy as this site; shared citations (Pingree, Agrippa, Picatrix).
Its only external dependency is Google Fonts (stripped in the port — this site is offline-first, system fonts only).

- **R15 — The Chronology wing** (`pages/chronology/`, 6 pages): timeline data → `core/data/chronology.js`
  (verbatim bodies + sources + labels, pure data), rendered/filtered by `app/chronology.js` (search, era, label
  chips, reveal animation honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`); companion pages ported onto the site design system;
  epistemic-label legend as a reusable component; the library merged as the wing's sources page; cross-links into
  Picatrix/Lilly/Jung/oracle pages; glossary terms + registry + engine-test invariants (43 entries, labels ∈ 4-set,
  every entry cited).
- **R16 — The historical-calculation layer** (`core/calendar.js`): Julian↔proleptic-Gregorian conversion
  (Fliegel–Van Flandern/Richards, verified vectors: reform 1582-10-04→10-14 = JDN 2299160; Dee 1527-07-13→07-23
  (+10d); Thales −584-05-28→05-22 (−6d, and our engine independently places that eclipse's syzygy at 14:00 UT that
  day); England 1752 (+11d, Lady-Day double-dating cautioned); ~11k-sample round-trip). Era-accuracy tiers derived
  from the underlying models (the astronomy-engine README states **no** year range — verified): **casting-grade
  1600–2200 · study-grade 500–1600 & 2200–3000 · illustrative −1999–500 · refuse outside** (Espenak–Meeus ΔT fit
  −1999…+3000; ΔT σ per Morrison & Stephenson 2004 = 0.8t², ±8.5 min of time at −700 → Moon honest to ~±¼°).
  Precision is gated by tier at DISPLAY time; historical charts show classical planets only + a ΔT line; timeline
  entries with defensible dates get **"cast this moment"** share-links (calendar-converted).
- **R17 — Cycles of History** (`pages/cycles.html`, `core/cycles.js`): geocentric tropical-of-date Jupiter–Saturn
  **great conjunctions** by bisection (our engine matched all 13 almanac vectors 1603–2020 to the arcminute, incl.
  the 1940-41/1980-81 triples & retrograde flags, and the 7 BCE Pisces triple at ~1° separation); triplicity/trigon
  classification with the doctrinal mean-cycle overlay (19.859 yr; ~220 yr/trigon astronomical vs 240 doctrinal;
  960 medieval vs Kepler's 794 = 40 conjunctions); the **eclipse finder** — the bundled lib already ships
  `SearchGlobalSolarEclipse`/`SearchLunarEclipse` (ground truth) and we teach the classical **ecliptic-limit**
  criterion on top (NASA: solar 15.39–18.59°, lunar 15.3–17.1°, umbral 9°30′/12°15′ classical; global claims ONLY,
  never local visibility). Doctrine layer cited to Abu Ma'shar (Yamamoto & Burnett, Brill 2000), Kepler *De Stella
  Nova* (1606), the Paris 1348 report (the 1345 Aquarius triple — engine-confirmed — as *documented belief,
  debunked cause*), Star of Bethlehem as *disputed* (Hughes 1976), Babylonian eclipse divination (Rochberg 1988/
  2004, Steele 2000, Parpola 1983: EAE 15–22, the 223-month cycle, šar pūhi).
- **R18 — Time-lords & progressions** (`pages/timelords.html`): **secondary progressions** (day-for-a-year, Valens
  IX.3; angles by Naibod arc 0.98564733°/yr only), **firdaria** (day Sun 10 · Venus 8 · Mercury 13 · Moon 9 ·
  Saturn 11 · Jupiter 12 · Mars 7 · NN 3 · SN 2 = 75; night starts Moon; Abu Ma'shar nodes-at-end default with the
  Bonatti nodes-after-Mars night variant as a documented toggle — the dispute flagged in-data; 7 equal sub-periods
  from the lord, nodes never sub-lords), **zodiacal releasing** from Spirit/Fortune (Valens IV.4–IV.10: sign years
  with **Capricorn 27**, 360-day years / 30-day months / 2.5-day / 5-hour units, loosing of the bond → opposite
  sign, only in signs ≥ 19). All ten verified test vectors become engine asserts.
- **AI integration**: `cycles` and `timelords` assistant kinds on the shared diviner engine — cite-bound, codebooked
  interprets ending in the five-part plain-words coda; honest frame first, always.

### NEXT PHASES — R19–R21 *(planned 2026-07-12; each data layer REQUIRES the research + adversarial-verify
workflow before encoding — the R15–R18 discipline: primary sources fetched, every load-bearing number recomputed)*

- **R19 — Praśna, Muhūrta & Tājika: the Indian horary/election mirror.** ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-13; research
  workflow: 1 inventory + 4 research + 4 adversarial verifiers, everything checked against the primary texts —
  KP's 249-entry table re-derived from first principles, Tājika verbatim vs Gansten's Hāyanaratna (Brill 2020),
  the muhūrta octant tables vs two independent published tables + a live pañcāṅga. Three tools on pages/prasna,
  /muhurta, /tajika with cited testimonies, contested values flagged in-data, AI assistants in the
  Jyotiṣa-historian voice, ~120 new engine-test asserts. Verified: engine-test all passed · audit 0 ·
  Chromium 61 pages 0 errors.) Original plan: the Vedic wing already computes the
  sidereal chart, nakṣatras, pañcāṅga, Vimśottarī daśā and the solar return — these three classical layers reuse
  exactly those calculations (excellent engine fit):
  1. **Praśna** (Indian horary): the query chart judged by lagna/ārūḍha, Moon's condition, and the praśna-specific
     rules. Niche primary sources to research & verify: *Praśna Mārga* (Kerala, 1649 — trans. B. V. Raman),
     *Ṣaṭpañcāśikā* of Pṛthuyaśas (56 verses, the praśna classic), *Daivajña Vallabhā*. Also **KP (Krishnamurti
     Paddhati)** as the modern niche system: the 249 sub-lord table is PURE Vimśottarī proportion arithmetic
     (self-verifiable, like the kameas) — cite Krishnamurti's six Readers.
  2. **Muhūrta** (Indian election, the direct mirror of the Picatrix engine): the 30 muhūrtas of the day,
     Rāhu-kāla/Yama-ghaṇṭa/Gulika periods (pure day-arc arithmetic), tithi/vāra/nakṣatra/yoga/karaṇa quality
     screens. Source: *Muhūrta Cintāmaṇi* of Rāma (1600 CE, trans. G. C. Sharma).
  3. **Tājika varṣaphala** (the Indo-Persian annual chart — the bridge tradition BETWEEN Lilly's solar return and
     the Vedic wing): tājika aspects, the year-lord (varṣeśvara), sahams (the Arabic Lots, Sanskritised — reuses
     lots.js!). Source: *Tājika-nīlakaṇṭhī* of Nīlakaṇṭha (1587, trans. M. Ramakrishna Bhat / Dykes scholarship).
- **R20 — The Kabbalah Tree of Life explorer.** The 10 sephiroth / 22 paths as an interactive map wired into the
  engines that already exist: the 7 doubles ↔ planets (→ kameas), the 12 simples ↔ signs, the 3 mothers ↔ elements
  (*Sefer Yetzirah*'s 3-7-12 division — trans. A. Kaplan), the Golden Dawn path↔tarot-trump attribution (→ the
  tarot deck), and a **gematria calculator** built on kamea.js's existing letterValues. Sources: Sefer Yetzirah,
  GD *777* (with the attribution disputes flagged in-data), Agrippa Book III, Regardie. Version differences
  (Ari vs GD tree, trump attributions) recorded as disputes, never silently resolved.
- **R21 — The auspicious-moment automation, deepened.** V1 SHIPPED with R15–R18 (the 🎯 one-click below). Next:
  the **cross-system moment scanner** — one time-range scan showing each tradition's verdict SEPARATELY and
  honestly (Lilly/Picatrix election · pañcāṅga quality · planetary hour · post-R19 muhūrta screen — compared,
  never merged), plus the per-tool deep codebooks rolled out everywhere: every testimony explained as
  *book meaning → literal real-life translation → implications*, the pattern the 🎯 prompt establishes.

### R22 — The by-hand layer, the Indian alchemy wing, practitioner tools & the runes ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-15)
*(four tools built in parallel — each engine module pure/headless, cited per record, contested values flagged
in-data — then integrated together. Verified: engine-test all passed · audit Problems: 0 (68 HTML, 125 JS) ·
real-Chromium sweep 68 pages, 0 errors.)*

- **Rasaśāstra & the yantra-mathematics** (`pages/rasa.html`, `core/yantra.js`, `data/rasa-data.js`): the Indian
  mercury-alchemy as history of chemistry only (18 saṃskāras + the rasaśālā apparatus; the Wujastyk "alchemical
  ghost" dispute flagged; mercury toxic, described never prescribed) beside the *provable* magic-square mathematics
  — the 9 navagraha 3×3 squares verified live (constants 15–39, grand total 729; flagged the modern printed
  tradition), Varāhamihira's sum-18 and the Khajuraho **Chautisa** most-perfect square, a **kaṭapayādi**
  encoder/decoder, and the 81-cell **Sarvatobhadra Chakra** cast for any date. The Indian sibling of the Picatrix
  kameas — the same mathematics with the opposite planetary logic (Sūrya, not Saturn, takes the 3×3).
- **Cast a chart by hand** (`pages/handcalc.html`, `core/handcalc.js`, `data/handcalc-data.js`): the classic
  ephemeris + atlas + book-of-tables workflow in five stations (per *The Astrology Podcast* ep. 396 / *Simply Math*
  2005), each hand step checked LIVE against the engine with the delta shown — clock→UT, Local Sidereal Time (the
  10 s/h book rule beside the exact 9.8565 s/h rate), planetary positions by linear interpolation AND proportional
  logarithms, and house cusps by double interpolation (Placidus). DeVore's printed plog values reproduced to 5 dp.
- **Practitioner-gap tools: transits · synastry · returns** (`core/transits.js`, `core/synastry.js`,
  `core/returns.js`; `pages/transits.html`, `pages/synastry.html`): the transit-to-natal timeline (exact-hit aspect
  perfections, retrograde 1-or-3 passes, stations & ingresses) with the profection overlay (the modern-Hellenistic
  "time-lord activated" filter, flagged); the chart-to-chart synastry aspect grid (Ptolemaic luminary core,
  *Tetrabiblos* IV.5; the full grid flagged modern, Jung's null 1952 experiment as the bridge) plus the house
  overlays both ways; and the lunar (monthly) / Saturn returns generalizing Lilly's solar revolution. Surfaced
  because Catherine Urban & Patrick Watson publicly attest their continued use — only the classical techniques and
  their primary sources are reproduced.
- **Elder Futhark runes** (`pages/runes.html`, `core/runes.js`, `data/runes-data.js`): the 24-stave oracle on the
  shared diviner engine — the Tacitus scatter-cast (*Germania* 10, framed a disputed PROTOTYPE only) or a single /
  three-rune draw, each drawn stave reading its ATTESTED medieval rune-poem stanza (Old English for all 24, Norse
  for exactly 16) ABOVE its flagged MODERN 20th-c. keyword, the two never blended; verified Unicode codepoints
  (gebo = U+16B7, no futhorc CEN), in-data disputes (⚑), no blank rune. The AI diviner (`buildRunesContext` /
  `buildRunesInterpretPrompt` / `runesDataBlock`) narrates the cast — cite-bound, the honest close, the five-part
  plain-words coda.

### R23 — The Grand Orchestrator, the abhicāra wing & the Yoga Sūtras ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-16)
*(three deliverables built in parallel — a meta AI layer over every engine + two self-contained study wings —
then integrated together. Verified: engine-test all passed · audit Problems: 0 (80 HTML, 136 JS) · real-Chromium
sweep 80 pages, 0 errors.)*

- **The Grand Orchestrator** (`pages/autopilot.html`, `app/autopilot.js`; additive edits to `core/llm-context.js`):
  one prompt, every engine. The user pastes their own **Claude** key (browser-direct, the shared `wb-llm-key-anthropic`
  store) and asks *any* question — simple→advanced, past or future date — and Claude drives **12 agentic tools** over
  the whole site (`listCapabilities` · `fullChart` · `vedicChart` · `transitHits` · `synastryPair` · `annualChart` ·
  `prasnaNow` · `muhurtaDay` · `momentScan` · `greatConjunctions` · `timelords` · `castRunes`), computing the real
  figures then explaining them **codebooked** — honest frame FIRST, each tradition kept separate. A self-contained
  12-round tool loop renders each call as an auditable `⚙ toolName(args)` note; the wrappers are **pure** (randomness
  from `ctx.rand`, mirroring the oracles). It adds **no new astrology** — it's the meta layer over the registry, so a
  **3-step future-tool recipe** (registry row → one tool schema + one `runTool` case → nothing else) makes any new
  engine join automatically. Skips a registry entry deliberately (double-counting the meta layer).
- **The abhicāra / ṣaṭkarman wing** (`pages/abhichara/*`, `core/abhichara.js`, `data/abhichara-data.js`): the Indian
  ritual-magic tradition as scholarship treats it — the Vedic **abhicāra** of the Atharvaveda and its tantric
  systematization into the **six acts** (śānti, vaśīkaraṇa, stambhana, vidveṣaṇa, uccāṭana, māraṇa), with every
  verified correspondence table (colours, mudrās, rosaries, finger-holds, the left-hand rule, the dark-fortnight
  timing) and the two **conflicting season/time schemes shown side by side (⚑)** — the texts' own disputes flagged,
  never resolved — plus Mahīdhara's 19-item apparatus schema and the Atharvan hostile/counter-charm layer. A pure,
  read-only **ṣaṭkarman timing screen** (ṛtu from the sidereal Sun · ghaṭikā-cycle block & day-part from sunrise ·
  pañcāṅga fortnight · a "does now match the prescription?" check, every row cited). **Described, never prescribed;**
  no operational output, no demonstrated validity — the eastern mirror of the Picatrix magic.
- **The Yoga Sūtras study wing** (`pages/yoga/*`, `core/yogasutra.js` + 4 data modules): all **196 sūtras** of the
  Pātañjala Yoga-sūtra rendered **word-by-word** across the four pādas — Devanāgarī (Vedic accents stripped), IAST,
  Sanskrit→gloss tables after Rama Prasada (1912) and whole-sūtra translations after Woods (1914) — with a live
  **dual-numbering** counts-by-edition table (194/195/196; Book III's disputed variant sūtra, Book IV's Bhoja
  numbering), a cross-book search, the aṣṭāṅga (eight-limb) map, and an **honest āsana layer** (the YS defines āsana
  only as *sthira-sukham āsanam* and names NO posture — the familiar postures are later haṭha/commentary layers) with
  5 inline SVG diagrams. Dating/authorship follow Maas (c. 325–425 CE); the siddhi (vibhūti) claims are the text's
  own, described never prescribed.
- **Verify gate** (all green, run with the conda `astro-workbench` node): `engine-test.mjs` → **all passed** ·
  `audit.mjs` → **Problems: 0** (80 HTML, 136 JS) · `browser-verify.mjs` real-Chromium sweep → **80 pages, 0 errors**.

### R24 — The expert library, the mega-menu, the bhāṣya layer & the verified directions ✅ **SHIPPED** (2026-07-16)
*(four deliverables — a new reference wing, a site-wide navigation overhaul, a content layer over an existing wing, and
an accuracy promotion — built in parallel and integrated together. Verified: engine-test all passed · audit Problems: 0
(85 HTML, 138 JS) · real-Chromium sweep 85 pages, 0 errors.)*

- **(a) The Practitioners' Library** (`pages/library/*`, `core/data/practitioners.js`, `app/library.js`): the expert
  catalog of the people and books behind every practice on the site — **133 verified records** across three wings
  (Western 38 · Indian 42 · esoteric 53), grouped by practice and graded by a **practitioner-recognition tier**
  (canon / respected / niche / academic; a `TIER_DEFS` + `TIER_VOCAB_NOTE` vocabulary, Dummett/Kaplan-anchored). Each
  record carries verified works `{title, year, publisher}`, optional journal papers, the **step-by-step method as its
  author teaches it** (never prescribed), honest-framing/belief flags and where the person↔work pairing was verified.
  Built by a **two-pass adversarial method** — an expert catalog compiled from named sources, then an independent
  re-check of every pairing against publisher/ISBN records and the figures' own sites, **hunting for invented people or
  books**: confirmed corrections applied, unverifiable entries dropped (e.g. a "Bruce Robertson" with no traceable
  works). A `callable:false` data-module registry entry; ~15 engine-test asserts; described never prescribed, no
  validity claimed.
- **(b) The mega-menu navigation overhaul** (`app/shared.js`): the flat grouped bar became a **five-group mega-menu**
  (Start · Cast · Traditions · Oracles · Reference) — desktop dropdown panels (wide groups in two columns), a mobile
  accordion drawer — that lists **47+ destinations BY NAME**, so nothing hides behind an "All Tools" page; the active
  page and its group light up via `currentSection()`. Paired with a new **roadmap page** (`pages/roadmap.html`) that
  names the planned subsections. Accessible: disclosure buttons with `aria-expanded`, arrow-key entry, Escape-to-close,
  focus management.
- **(c) The Yoga Sūtras bhāṣya layer** (`core/yogasutra.js` flatten + the 4 data modules, `app/yoga.js`, `yoga.css`):
  every sūtra now carries a **one-to-three-sentence gist of the classical Vyāsa-bhāṣya** — an original paraphrase
  *after the Vyāsa-bhāṣya, trans. Woods (1914)* — shown in a **collapsible block beneath the translation** (**196
  gists**; the one disputed variant sūtra has none, which is exactly why the vulgate omits it — a one-line note says
  so). Threaded through the ALL_SUTRAS flatten so `sutraByRef`/search carry it too; 4 new engine-test invariants
  (bhashyaSrc XOR variant-null; exactly one null; every non-variant non-empty; the exact source string).
- **(d) The abhicāra DIRECTIONS_DEITIES promotion** (`core/data/abhichara-data.js`): the six-acts directional
  deity/quarter rows (§6) were **promoted from candidates to VERIFIED** against two independent full-text sources —
  Bühnemann's Tables 26.1–26.2 ("The Six Rites of Magic", in White ed., *Tantra in Practice*) and M. Ullrey's UCSB
  dissertation — the accuracy-check discipline applied to a previously provisional table.
- **Verify gate** (all green, conda `astro-workbench` node): `engine-test.mjs` → **all passed** · `audit.mjs` →
  **Problems: 0** (85 HTML, 138 JS) · `browser-verify.mjs` real-Chromium sweep → **85 pages, 0 errors**. Two extra
  Chromium drives: a yoga pāda page's Vyāsa-bhāṣya `<details>` opens with text (51 blocks, 458-char gist), and
  `library/western.html` renders its 38 practitioner cards — both pass, 0 console errors.

### R25 — The revamp (WP1+WP2), the Great Works, the Learn curriculum & the first roadmap stubs ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-16)**
*(five parallel deliverables — two site-wide craft passes and three new wings — built by separate work-packages and
integrated together via three manifests. Verified: engine-test all passed · audit Problems: 0 · real-Chromium sweep of
every page, 0 errors.)*

- **(a) Design System 2.0** (`assets/css/*` token + component layer, the export path): a **token layer**
  (colour / space / type / radius / `--sticky-top`) and a reusable **component layer** landed *under* the existing look
  with **zero visual drift**, plus the **chart/reading export-styling fix** (exports now carry the site's own CSS
  instead of rendering bare) and a sweep of quick wins. Purely additive — every prior page renders identically, so the
  85-page Chromium baseline stayed green.
- **(b) The chart-wheel beauty pass** (`app/chart.js` + the SVG diagram family): the wheel renderer gained **cluster
  fans** (stacked planets fan out instead of overprinting), **orb-weighted aspect lines** (a tighter orb draws a
  stronger stroke), **conjunction brackets**, **degree ticks** and an **elemental wash** behind the signs — and the
  same visual grammar was carried across the diagram family, so every chart on the site now reads as one system.
- **(c) The Great Works wing** (`core/data/greatworks.js`, `app/greatworks.js`, `pages/greatworks/*` — 7 pages):
  author→book→chapter study guides for the primary texts behind the esoteric wings — **9 authors · 23 works · 145
  chapters/treatises · 126 chapter cross-links · 71 study-path links** — each chapter mapped to the tool that *computes*
  what it describes. Public-domain status decided **per record** under the US 95-year rule (PD editions quoted &
  edition-cited; copyrighted editions cite-only), contested/spurious material flagged (the Corpus Hermeticum **XV**
  numbering gap shown, never renumbered; the spurious Fourth Book kept apart). A `callable:false` registry entry + an
  engine-test section that asserts **every** siteMapping/studyPath link resolves and the refuted mappings stay absent.
  Described, never prescribed.
- **(d) Learn — astrology & the mathematics** (`pages/learn.html`, `app/learn.js`): a step-by-step curriculum — **8
  modules · 31 numbered lessons · 4 milestones** — from the honest frame to every wing, with the **mathematics made
  first-class** (each lesson states the real formula, verified) and **localStorage progress** ticks (per-module counts,
  an aria-live progress bar, reset). Works fully with JS disabled (progressive enhancement); promoted to the **gold
  flagship of the home "Start here" band**.
- **(e) Tithi-praveśa + Kūṭa matching** (`core/tithi-pravesha.js`, `core/kuta.js` + `data/kuta-data.js`, two pages): the
  first two **planned Vedic roadmap stubs shipped**. *Tithi-praveśa* — the annual/monthly tithi return (the Moon
  regaining its exact natal elongation in its natal sidereal sign), **verified to the second** against JHora
  (2026 ⇒ 2026-10-09 11:56 UT); a modern-lineage technique with **no classical BPHS anchor** (flagged), the
  solar/soli-lunar month fork shown honestly. *Kūṭa matching* — the North's aṣṭakūṭa (36 guṇa) + the Tamil South's ten
  porutham, **every table cited**, contested values flagged and never resolved (the varṇa air/earth swap, the nāḍī
  exempt lists, the bhakūṭa points-restoration dispute, and the **North/South 5-9 contradiction shown both ways**). A
  sensitive-domain custom: what the tradition computes, never advice. Two `callable:false` registry entries + a
  20-assertion engine-test section on the verified vectors.
- **Verify gate** (all green, conda `astro-workbench` node): `engine-test.mjs` → **all passed** · `audit.mjs` →
  **Problems: 0** (95 HTML, 146 JS) · `browser-verify.mjs` real-Chromium sweep → **95 pages, 0 errors**; the mega-menu
  drive re-run after the four new nav items (Learn · Great Works · Tithi-praveśa · Kūṭa Matching) — all appear, no group
  overflow.

### R26 — The revamp, phase 3: the page sweeps ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-16)**
*(six parallel page-sweeps over the DS2 token/component layer, integrated in one working tree and verified whole-site.)*

- **(a) Chrome & footer diet + hero** — the shared header/mega-menu tightened, the footer put on a `footer-diet`, and the home hero reworked so the top of every page reads as one system.
- **(b) The mega-calculators** — a sticky **results-rail** (`app/rail.js`, opt-in per `section.panel[id]`) + **verdict banners** across Workbench, the Book I/III masters, Kūṭa, transits & the rest, so a long tool page navigates itself and states its bottom line up top.
- **(c) The scanners** — **filterbars** + **sticky `.table-scroll` tables** on Cycles, Moments & the Library, so big result sets stay scannable.
- **(d) The oracles** — a **staged casting reveal** (reduced-motion-first: colour/opacity only, instant-reveal escape) + the **unified `.chat`** diviner panel shared across Geomancy, Runes, Tarot & the I Ching.
- **(e) The reading-room study wings** — the Yoga, Great Works & Library wings gained the in-page **workrail** and a consistent reading column.
- **(f) The explorers** — **diagram-token + badge migrations** across Kabbalah, Chronology & Jung, so every diagram and status chip draws from the shared DS2 tokens.
- **Verify gate** (conda `astro-workbench` node): `engine-test.mjs` → **all passed** · `audit.mjs` → **Problems: 0** (95 HTML, 147 JS) · `browser-verify.mjs` real-Chromium sweep → **95 pages, 0 errors** (Book III master re-checked ×6 for the mid-flight `insertBefore` race — clean); the mega-menu drive + eight interaction spot-drives all pass. Mobile sanity at 390 px greened Home/Workbench/Yoga (two scoped fixes: yoga IAST/Devanāgarī `overflow-wrap`, and a `fieldset` shrink guard for the AI-connect panels); the Geomancy 12-house shield grid flagged as a known residual.

### R27 — The Great Confluence: the cross-tradition atlas ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-16)**
*(a new wing that lays nine wisdom traditions side by side on one era-warped vertical time axis and draws the **documented transmissions** between them as directed arcs — influence mapped, never validity. Sister to the Hermetic Chronology: the Chronology reads one tradition's story in order; the Confluence sees the whole map. Built by two parallel builders + an integrator over an adversarially-verified research corpus.)*

**The research corpus.** Nine independent research domains (kabbalah, yoga-vedānta, tantra-rasaśāstra, Buddhist, Daoist, Western alchemy/Hermetica, Abrahamic mysticism, and two cross-tradition "confluence" sets) were compiled and adversarially verified across 19 agents; the verification pass logged **109 corrections** and resolved a 189→**188 entries** / **153→151 edges** merge (5 duplicate entry-copies dropped with their unique sources unioned, 4 edge endpoints repointed, edges deduped on `(from,to,kind)`). Bodies, sources and contested blocks are reproduced **verbatim**; four synthesis entries (Jung, Corpus Hermeticum, Picatrix, Yijing) were authored to resolve cross-domain references, cited to the same standard.

- **Data** — `assets/js/core/data/confluence.js`: 188 cited entries (texts/people/events/translations/institutions) across 9 lanes + 151 transmission edges (29 cross-lane), each entry and arc labelled **documented / disputed / debunked / conspiracy**, contested points carrying both positions. Generated from the domain JSONs + `synthesis-additions.json` by applying `merge-instructions.md` exactly (Pico text↔event pair found already linked, so per merge §4 no synthetic edge forced — logged, not fabricated).
- **Engine** — `assets/js/core/confluence.js`: **PURE** (no DOM/Date/random). `ERA_BANDS` + `timeScale(zoom)` — a piecewise-linear era-warp (30→380 px/century, `totalHeight` ≈ 3626 px, monotonic, exact inverse); `layoutConfluence` collision-stacks nodes into non-overlapping sub-track rows and builds vertical-tangent Bézier edge geometry; `filterEntries` (lane/kind/label/century/text/crossings-only); `threadFrom` (deterministic chronological transmission chain); `entryBySlug`; `confluenceStats`. Nine lanes in the fixed crossing-minimising order christian→alchemy-west→kabbalah→islamic→[confluence spine]→yoga-vedanta→tantra-rasa→buddhist→daoist.
- **The page** — `pages/confluence.html` + `assets/js/app/confluence.js` + `assets/css/confluence.css`: the atlas shell paints **only** from `layoutConfluence()` output (SVG underlay of era zebra, lane washes, ruler, certainty bands + all 151 Bézier edges; HTML layer of kind-shaped, epistemic-coloured entry buttons). Roving-tabindex keyboard nav, hover/focus path-lighting, a detail drawer (contested panel verbatim, in/out Journeys, described-never-prescribed technique block), filters that hide/dim without re-layout, three zoom levels with year-re-anchor, a "follow this thread" walk with `#thread=`/`#slug` deep links, and a semantic single-column **Ledger** mode (forced <720 px, and the print view). Page-scoped CSS on DS2 tokens, reduced-motion-first.
- **Integration (this round).** `shared.js` nav (Traditions group + `currentSection`); a new **18-assert** `engine-test.mjs` section (188 entries, 9 exact lanes, all edges resolve, enum membership, sortYearEnd≥sortYear, contested≥2, every siteLink on disk, monotonic `timeScale` + height, deterministic overlap-free layout, crossings filter, `threadFrom('sirr-i-akbar')→'oupnekhat'`, stats totals); registry capability `confluence-atlas` (callable); an **8-term** glossary category `Confluence` (Transmission (textual), Prisca theologia, Neidan, Dhikr, Hesychasm, Lectio divina, Vipassanā, Era-warped scale); the **13th Grand Orchestrator tool** `confluence_atlas` + the honest-frame-first `buildConfluenceContext` / `…InterpretPrompt` / `confluenceDataBlock` and the `confluence` divination-assistant kind; a `#hiw-confluence` how-it-works section (the era-warp px/century table, the layout algorithm, the provenance) and cross-links from Contents, Tools, About & the Chronology.
- **The honest frame (locked).** The atlas plots **INFLUENCE** — who demonstrably read, rendered, answered or absorbed whom, with a citation on every link — and **never** doctrinal validity; debunked and conspiracy claims stay on the map, drawn faint, because false belief is also history; contested datings and directions show both positions and are **never resolved**.

### R28 — "The Deep Study Program" planning round ✅ **PLANNED (2026-07-16, plan-only — no code)**
*(Eleven Fable research agents across two verified workflows; 88 claims web-checked by adversarial
verifiers, 23 corrections applied in place. All specs live in **`docs/plans/r28/`** — the
authoritative phased roadmap is **`docs/plans/r28/ROADMAP.md`**, execution model: Opus codes
phase N while Fable researches phase N+1.)*

- **The 132-video Vedic playlist decoded** (Vasishtha Astrologer; 100% of titles + per-session topics recovered from metadata; live count now 133) → a two-page plan: `vedic/course.html` (9 sections, every rule re-grounded to BPHS Santhanam / Phaladīpikā Sareen — the anonymous teacher is a teaching-order witness only) + an 18-tool build list **T1–T18** (8 are surfacing jobs: the engine already computes pañcadhā-maitrī, graha-dṛṣṭi, 14 vargas, aṣṭakavarga, full ṣaḍbala — but shows no N/S-Indian chart figure at all). A do-NOT-build list keeps remedies/gemstones descriptive-only.
- **The three-layer chart-output standard** for all ~24 outputs (figure+legend → always-visible "In plain words" with a banned-phrase engine test → collapsed cited mechanics), glossary hover-popovers over the 247 terms, a narrate mode, the shared period-strip renderer for the five timing outputs (~20 coder-days, 6 gated phases).
- **The honest comparison page** (`compare.html`): ~30 products surveyed & cited; the licensing fact — zero state no-demonstrated-validity; 11 novelty claims each shipped as claim+verify+qualifier; a mandatory "what they do better" column; staleness badges + yearly re-survey.
- **The Buddhist scriptures wing**: licensing verified (SuttaCentral/Sujato **CC0**, Mahāsaṅgīti Pāli PD, Wong Mou-lam 1930 fresh-PD; NC/SA firewall for DPD/Thanissaro); tiered word-by-word scope measured at ~7× the Yoga-Sūtras wing (Dhammapada alone ~5,600 gloss slots); refrain/peyyāla model; per-record licence tags engine-tested.
- **The Practices wing**: 8 practice groups, the ~60-mudrā catalog (Gheraṇḍa 25 + HYP 10 + iconographic + tantric) with parameterized stroke-SVG hand/body art, 8 complete-book modules, a descriptive-voice lint. **Blocker logged:** the Gheraṇḍa archive scan b28140102 is the 1895 Bombay edition, not the cited 1914–15 SBH printing — re-pin before any record ships.
- **The atlas upgrade plan**: 13 reference designs surveyed; Histomap breathing-lane widths **rejected with argument** (width would encode curation as importance); 11 work packages (minimap, search-fly-to, edge-legibility program + per-edge epistemic labels, semantic-zoom clustering, guided-tour stories, SVG poster export) + a data-growth contract for the coming wings.
- **The dynamic-site decision memo**: the architecture ladder analyzed (PWA → tiny sync backend → SSR → full dynamic); verdict **stay static** — adopt PWA + Pagefind now; the Hono+D1+passkeys+E2E-blob sync backend is fully pre-designed but **trigger-gated**; SSR/full-dynamic rejected; Swiss Ephemeris stays out (AGPL/CHF 700 vs MIT astronomy-engine); BYOK AI stays browser-direct (birth data never transits an operator). Plus the fully-static learn×handcalc **cast-along program** (9 stations, graded deltas against engine-test's pinned vectors, 7 seeded drill types, 31 named diagrams).
- **The Eastern greats expansion**: 25 ranked figures in 5 clusters with exact PD verdicts — Varāhamihira the flagship (two US-PD Bṛhajjātaka translations); Yogananda's 1946 **first edition** verified PD (SRF v. Ananda, 206 F.3d 1322, holdings recorded precisely); BPHS has NO PD English (Santhanam cite-only); honest "no PD — say so" verdicts for Tantrāloka (Dyczkowski's 2023 complete translation is copyrighted — the verifier caught the plan's false "none exists"), Śōbōgenzō, Lamrim Chenmo; a PD-flip calendar 2027–2036 wired to quote-gating; ~26 new atlas entries + edges (incl. Kūkai↔Xiuyao-jing).

### UI3 — The Interaction Revamp: physics, instruments & the illuminated observatory ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-16)**
*(A five-expert consultation — web designer, artist, physics-interaction designer, data-viz expert, atlas expert — synthesized by an arbiter into one spec + a six-builder partition, built by six parallel Opus builders + integrator, then a fresh-eyes final verifier whose NOT-GREEN verdict bounced nine precise defects back to their owners before the round could ship. The full loop: experts → arbiter → build → integrate → verify → fix → re-verify → green.)*

- **The physics foundation** — `app/motion.js`: the site's ONE spring/momentum conductor (critically-damped springs, presets snappy/gentle/molasses engine-tested as exact constants, velocity-tracked drag, rubber-band, settle-detection that stops the rAF loop — `__motionStats().running === false` at idle is now asserted on all 96 pages). No motion library vendored: with no build step there is no tree-shaking, and ~280 hand-rolled lines beat every candidate. Physics is BANNED from information (no reveal-stagger on results, no parallax, no scroll-hijack — recorded as law).
- **The control language** — the shared **moment-picker** (the site's most-repeated interaction built once: named IANA offsets verified against July-2026 data incl. Cairo DST and Mexico City's abolition, recent-places memory, throw-at-mount legacy-id guard, 13 pages migrated), the sticky **action bar** with compute choreography (banner focus → RM-gated scroll; export buttons moved out of forms), the **Ctrl-K command palette** over NAV_GROUPS + REGISTRY, dial inputs (component shipped; page opt-ins deferred where no zodiacal input exists), one-primary-button-per-region law, 94 breadcrumb trails rewritten to menu geography.
- **The instruments** — the chart wheel is now a focusable, click-to-inspect, **rotate-with-momentum instrument** (snap-to-planet detents, pin cards with the Lilly −5..+5 dignity line, aspect-hover path lighting); NEW pure renderers: North/South-Indian rāśi charts (conventions verified against ≥3 authorities before coding), the shared brushable **period-strip** (firdāriā, zodiacal releasing, transit hits with crosshair + brushed row-filtering), weekly transit **heat table**, anchored **score bars** whose domains derive from the exported weight tables (never guessed). ONE vendored file in the whole round: d3-array's `ticks.js` (ISC, ~2 KB, verbatim + LICENSE).
- **The Illuminated Observatory** (art layer) — body grain + aurora washes, 15 engraving-style wing frontispieces (Lilly's wings get his actual square horary figure), a ≥40-glyph stroke icon sprite, epistemic labels as TEXTURE (documented=solid, disputed=hatched, debunked=faded+strike), and pure `core/skyart.js`: exact-terminator moon phases, the unequal-hours planetary dial (with pre-sunrise day-rollback fixed and pinned by a mocked 03:00 drive), a deterministic starfield — the Now page is an instrument panel. Home hero: one gold CTA + the three doors; the covenant moved byte-identically (diff-proven).
- **The atlas as showpiece** — momentum pan in a contained instrument frame, continuous spring zoom bridging the three layout levels without lying about positions, semantic-zoom cluster pills, the minimap with draggable lens, search-with-fly-to, rich hover cards, sticky lane heads: 53/53 drives green incl. RM MutationObserver zero-world-transform and idle asserts.
- **The verification story (the round's real lesson):** the integrator's load-level gate was green while six interaction deliverables were silently missing — only the final verifier's hand-driven §10.2 drives caught the workbench wheel's wrong-shape crash (the site's ONE console error), timelords/transits strips imported-but-never-called, synastry's missing figure-root + roving, the unmounted oracle action bars, the inert vedic inspect, and the Now-dial disagreement. A two-fixer bounce-back round repaired all of it with per-fix drive proofs; the re-verifier closed at **GREEN: 8/8 failed drives now pass, zero console errors site-wide** (last residual: `setPointerCapture` guards). Load-only gates cannot see missing figures; interaction drives are now part of the standing gate (six `ui3-*.mjs` suites wired into engine-test + browser-verify).
- **Gate:** engine-test all passed (incl. 6 new UI3 suites + the 18 confluence asserts) · audit 96 HTML / 175 JS, 0 problems · Chromium 96 pages 0 errors (load + drives + RM/390/print passes) · menu-drive 53 destinations · framing byte-lock diff-proven on every moved block.

### R28 — the surfaced Vedic engine, the explain layer, graded journeys & the installable site ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-16)**
*(Executing the R28 "Deep Study Program" plan. Five parallel Opus builders + a research fleet → one integrator. The Jyotiṣa data was compiled by **ten research agents** that produced **five verified datasets — 295 verified records** in total: 36 yoga rules, 108 planet-in-bhāva delineations, the pañcadhā-maitrī / graha-dṛṣṭi / combustion surfacings, the 151 atlas edge-labels, and the explain-layer term set. Never hand-transcribed: every data module is emitted by a generator that asserts its counts, unique keys and single-witness/absence integrity before writing.)*

- **The yoga detector (V1+V2).** 36 classical yogas stored as **machine-checkable rules read as data** (`core/data/yoga-rules.js`, generated) and evaluated by `core/yogas.js` against a `castVedic()` reading — the Pañca-Mahāpuruṣa five, the solar/lunar flanking sets, Gaja-Kesarī, the Vipreet trio, Nīca-bhaṅga, the Rāja & Dhana sets, the three Parivartana classes, Kendrādhipati doṣa and the modern Kāla-Sarpa. **The contested-discipline invariant, enforced mechanically:** a contested rule is NEVER reduced to a bare boolean — it is reported `conditional` with **every** position surfaced and none resolved (Gaja-Kesarī bare vs conditioned, Kāla-Sarpa by sign vs degree, Nīca-bhaṅga across three recensions computed per position; the rest carried verbatim). New page `pages/vedic/yogas.html` groups by family with per-condition ✓/✗ and a ⚑ contested panel; the detector is a **callable AI tool** (`detectYogas`).
- **The bhāva-delineation browser (V1+V2).** 108 planet-in-house records (`core/data/bhava-phala.js`, generated) with **two witnesses kept side by side and never merged** — Phaladīpikā ch. 8 and Sārāvalī ch. 30 — an agreement badge, a contradiction callout where they diverge, a sensitive-claim flag on the harsh lines, and the Rāhu/Ketu **single-witness absence note** (Sārāvalī does not treat the nodes in houses; `agreement:null`, honest note, no fabrication). New page `pages/vedic/delineation.html`: a 12×9 keyboard-rovable grid with a "from a chart" mode that rings a cast chart's nine placements. Callable AI tool `bhavaPhala`. **Research corrections applied through the data** (and back-annotated into the R28 plan doc): the Vipreet trio = Phaladīpikā 6.63/6.65/6.69 + Uttara Kālāmṛta 4.22 (not BPHS ch. 36); Sārāvalī planets-in-bhāvas = the single ch. 30 (not 30–38).
- **Graha-bala surfaced (V1+V2).** Three engines already inside `shadbala()` are now exported without recomputing anything that touches ṣaḍbala (**pinned byte-equal** to git HEAD on three fixed charts): the pañcadhā (five-fold) **maitrī** matrix, the 9×9 **graha-dṛṣṭi** grid (whole-sign full/special aspects alongside the BPHS-26 sphuṭa scheme — a contested presentation shipped both ways), and per-graha **combustion (asta)** flags. The shared Vedic panel renders all three via a guarded dynamic import (a missing export degrades to an empty panel, never a load error).
- **The explain layer (X).** A three-layer output standard — legend → **"In plain words"** → collapsed mechanics — over the Workbench, horary and nativity pages (`core/explain/**`, pure & DOM-free; `app/explain-block.js` + `app/glosstip.js` inject their own scoped CSS, style.css untouched). **Attributed voice only:** the second-person-destiny register is a `BANNED_PHRASES` set grep-tested over five reference charts. A document-delegated **glosstip** popover (position:fixed, escapes table clipping; toggletip/first-tap, Esc-dismiss) resolves `.term-chip`/`.gloss-link` slugs against the real GLOSSARY. Also a title-only-affordance sweep on the Workbench moment table (the site's one load-bearing `title=` replaced with visible text + ⓘ chips).
- **Atlas edge epistemic labels (A · WP-3d).** All **151** `CONFLUENCE_EDGES` regenerated with `label` + `bestCitation` + `note`, merged verbatim from the verified `edge-labels.json` (entries + lanes **byte-identical** to the pre-R28 module, bijection asserted). Distribution **141 documented / 9 disputed / 1 debunked** (the *Kybalion*'s claimed ancient Hermetic source, which does not exist — Deslippe). Disputed arcs render dashed-faded with a ⚑; the debunked arc renders faint + struck, never removed; hover cards and the drawer/ledger Journeys carry the badge + best witness. **The label grades the transmission CLAIM, never the doctrine** — the honesty covenant the nodes obey, now on the lines between them.
- **The installable site (P).** A hand-written service worker (`sw.js`) — versioned caches, shell precache + lazy runtime caching, **cross-origin passthrough so BYOK LLM calls never enter the cache**, consent-based updates via the site toast (never auto-skip/auto-reload), a `KILL_SWITCH` panic path, and a **localhost no-op** so dev + the verify gate are unaffected — plus `manifest.webmanifest` (inline-SVG icons, zero binary assets). A dependency-free `scripts/build-search-index.mjs` emits a static `assets/search-index.json` surfaced as the command palette's third **"On this site"** full-text tier (lazy, load-once, pure ranked search).
- **Integration.** Two new Traditions nav items + `currentSection()` special-cases; the SW registrant mounted in `mountChrome` (guarded); the manifest linked from `index.html`; two callable tools wired into `runTool`/`toolNames` and two AI **interpret kinds** (`vedicyogas`/`vedicdelineation`) wired through `llm-context.js` + `divination-assistant.js` (honest frame preserved, two witnesses never merged); registry pages retargeted to the new tool pages; how-it-works + contents + tools cross-links; five `r28-*.mjs` suites wired into engine-test **and** browser-verify.
- **Gate:** engine-test all passed (incl. the 5 new `r28-*.mjs` suites — vedic-core, vedic-ui, explain, atlas-labels, pwa-search — run isolated, plus ṣaḍbala byte-equality pins and the contested-never-a-boolean invariant) · audit 98 HTML / 188 JS, 0 problems · Chromium 98 pages 0 errors **with the service worker registered** (localhost no-op) · menu-drive 55 destinations (grew +2; all resolve, keys unique, both new pages highlight their nav item + mount the AI assistant) · `assets/search-index.json` rebuilt as the final step (98 pages). Research corrections propagated from the data into the R28 plan doc as dated in-place annotations; original planning text never deleted.
- **Atlas visual-polish pass (shipped with R28).** After R28 landed, a screenshot review of the Confluence atlas found four visual defects invisible to the error-only gate (a blank-but-error-free page passes browser-verify — the UI3 lesson). All fixed in the atlas's own files: (1) the sticky toolbar slid under the site header → offset to `--sticky-top`; (2) rightmost-lane node labels clipped at the frame edge → a **deterministic `labelSide`** in the pure layout flips a label left when a right box would overrun the world; (3) same-lane label collisions (Kathā ✕ Śvetāśvatara) → a geometric per-lane de-conflict (right → left → nudge → `.is-quiet`), with a new engine-test assertion that **no two visible same-lane label boxes overlap at zoom 1**; (4) all lane dots rendered gold → root cause was a **CSS comment-parse bug** (`--t-*/` prematurely closed the header comment, and error-recovery dropped the entire first `.cfl-page` custom-property block, so every `--lane-*` fell back to `--accent`) — reworded the comment, restoring nine distinct lane hues on legend + chips + lane-heads. Verified by screenshot at multiple widths + the full gate.

### R29-plan addendum — the five esoteric libraries ✅ **PLANNED (2026-07-17, plan-only — no code)**
Five Fable catalogers + one adversarial verification pass (two hard date errors fixed, one licence upgraded to VERIFIED-with-scope, one pseudo-dispute dissolved, zero fabrications) surveyed four esoteric libraries — Peterson's **Esoteric Archives**, the **Hermetic Library**, **chaosmatrix.org**, **sacred-texts.com** — plus **magicgatebg.com** as a **discovery index only (pirate mirror: never link, cite, or ingest)**. The merged build plan is **`docs/plans/r29/esoteric-libraries.md`**: **384 works cataloged** with per-edition PD verdicts, **48 atlas additions**, **44 museum practice records**, **27 ranked tools** (+2 parked, 6 killed with reasons), slotted into R29–R33 as additive work packages WP-E1…WP-E5 that displace nothing committed.
- **Sourcing covenant (binding):** cite the editor's transcription; QUOTE only independent pre-1931 PD witnesses (Turner 1655–57, Scot 1584, Mathers 1889/1898/1904, the Equinox 1909–13, Spare 1913, SBE 1–50); the two quotable modern islands are the kopyleft Principia Discordia and Peterson's CC-BY 4.0 Ars Notoria transcription. Hosting is never a PD verdict.
- **Atlas contract honored with math:** the grimoire/Thelema/chaos/Wicca sources land in **alchemy-west** (bands stay under the WARN line as same-lane braids); the confluence lane admits only 6 meeting events across R32–R33, **gated on WP-6 clustering shipping first**; the alchemy-west↔confluence corridor takes its last 3 edges to cap, the overflow deferred to a transmission-graph tool page.
- **Framing:** all operative content per the abhicāra precedent with named harm callouts (Abramelin ordeal, Goetia compel, Liber III razor, Death Posture hypoxia, TOPY); the sigil generator ships verifier-hardened (preset examples only, no user-phrase export); the Goetia explorer is philology-first and built last; **ONA totally excluded**; Yezidi material deferred pending Kreyenbroek-level care.
- **Quick wins first (WP-E1, R29):** the Heptameron hour-election layer, the Thelemic era-legis calculator, Liber Resh solar-station times, Crowley's 1917 "How Horoscopes Are Faked" honest-science dossier, and the Sefer ha-Levanah mansion column — all engine-reuse.

### R29 — the Vedic course, narrate mode & the first library quick-wins ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-17)**
- **Vedic course page (B-COURSE).** `pages/vedic/course.html` — "The Parāśarī course": the theory companion to the Jagannath-Hora reading, walking Jyotiṣa in the order it is actually taught (playlist-curriculum §3, Page A). Nine units (grahas · rāśis · the two chart formats · bhāvas · graha strength · planets-in-houses · house classifications · yogas · where-the-course-stops), each = cited concept prose + a classical-citation block (BPHS tr. Santhanam 1984, Phaladīpikā tr. Sareen, Sārāvalī ch. 30) + a varied honest-frame note + tool chips to the computing tool. The 132-lesson "Astrology Classes" playlist is acknowledged ONCE as a teaching-order witness, never an authority; the māraka unit carries the strongest non-prediction frame (hyleg precedent); a CONTESTED register lists every intra-tradition dispute shown both ways. No new engine/data/registry entry (a teaching page); scroll-spy in-page nav; nav key `vediccourse`. Learn M6 gains lesson 6.4; glossary gains the house-classification terms (Trikoṇa, Trika, Upachaya, Triṣaḍāya, Yogakāraka, Māraka, Bhāveśa, Naisargika Maitrī).
- **Narrate mode (B-NARRATE).** chart-ux §6 (narrate mode) landed for the Workbench wheel — the final chart-UX interaction piece. `core/explain/narrate.js` (PURE) builds the canonical Western-wheel reading order (Ascendant → chart ruler → Sun → Moon → the sect light → angular planets → tightest aspect → Part of Fortune) as `[{el,title,say}]`, each `say` an attributed-voice sentence, grep-tested clean of the second-person register; `app/narrate.js` renders the "🔊 Read this chart aloud" rail that lights the wheel via `data-el` stamps (no rAF; native `scrollIntoView` gated by `motionOK()`). `reading.narrative` is now a serialized field on the Workbench reading, so the AI assistant, the JSON export and the Markdown export all inherit the canonical order. Registered `callable:false` for the reference index. Reusable for the horary/vedic/tarot wheels via the same `renderNarrate` contract + per-tool `narrateX(reading)` builders (§6.1).
- **T2 Era Legis + T3 Liber Resh (B-THELEMIC, WP-E1).** Two zero-data, museum-framed tools on the existing astronomy engine at `pages/thelemic-times.html`. `core/thelemic.js` (PURE) exports `eraLegis(date, {mode})` — the Thelemic {docosade}{year} Anno notation counted from the 1904 vernal equinox in 22-year docosades, with the ☉/☽ stamp; the contested year-start (exact equinox instant vs conventional March 20) is encoded both ways, default exact — and `solarStations(date, lat, lon)` — the four Liber Resh moments (sunrise/noon/sunset/midnight = two horizon crossings + the two solar culminations), each labelled with its cited 1911 adoration name (Ra/Ahathoor/Tum/Khephra). Rise/set reused from planetary-hours.js. Both registered (callable) and wired into the Grand Orchestrator's `runTool`, glossary + engine-test (`r29-thelemic.mjs`) added, named-in-nav under Traditions. Sourcing covenant honoured: museum voice throughout, pre-1931 PD witnesses only (Liber Resh / Equinox I(6) 1911; Liber AL 1904/1909), the standing no-validity note on both panels. Zero atlas impact.

### R30 — the Buddhist scriptures wing & the honest comparison ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-17)**
- **The Buddhist scriptures wing (B-bud-data + B-bud-wing).** Phase A (part) of `docs/plans/r28/buddhist-canon.md` §8 — the reading-room over the three Tier-1 texts, in the manner of the Yoga-sūtra wing. `pages/buddhist/{index,metta,heart,mn118,sources}.html` + `app/buddhist.js` + `assets/css/buddhist.css` render the **Metta Sutta** (Snp 1.8, 43 segments), the shorter **Heart Sūtra** (Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya, 16 segments, Sanskrit) and the **Ānāpānassati Sutta** (MN 118, 154 segments = 105 full + 49 refrain-uses over 6 refrains). The pure engine `core/buddhist.js` + `core/data/buddhist/{metta,heart,mn118,index}.js` (generated verbatim, no DOM/rAF/BOM, NFC-clean) exposes `textById / recordsFor / expandRefrain / reconstruct / buddhistStats / searchBuddhist` over a frozen contract `{ref, pali|sanskrit, words:[{w,gloss,gram,ped}], translation:{text,source}|null, notes}`. **Provenance & the licence firewall:** every translation is verbatim from a zero-restriction source — the Pāli suttas from Bhikkhu Sujato's CC0 SuttaCentral translations, the Heart Sūtra from F. Max Müller's SBE 49 (1894, US-PD-by-age); the Mahāsaṅgīti Pāli root is declared PD via SuttaCentral. Word-glosses are *original* prose after the PD PED (1921–25) and Monier-Williams (1899), cited per word — the copyrighted Digital Pāḷi Dictionary used only as a lookup instrument, never copied. Each record carries a per-layer licence tag ({cc0, pd-age, original}); `buddhistStats().byLicence = {cc0:197, 'pd-age':16}`, glosses uniformly `original`. Proven by a **reconstruction invariant** over all 213 records (word tokens rejoin to the exact root text, including the 49 peyyāla segments after refrain expansion). AT parity: every Pāli/Sanskrit word is a keyboard-reachable `<button>` popover **and** an always-in-DOM `<details>` word-by-word table (no hover-only glosses); the peyyāla model glosses each refrain once with on-demand "show the full refrain" expansion; Heart renders 3 sourced CONTESTED cruxes (incl. the Nattier Chinese-apocryphon origins debate) resolved neither way; the Metta colophon (translation:null) is shown honestly, not invented. New registry reference entry `buddhist-canon` (callable:false); 10 "Buddhist canon" glossary terms; named-in-nav under Traditions. Dhammapada, MN 10 and the Tier-2/Tier-3 catalogue pages remain planned (roadmap stub).
- **The honest comparison (B-COMPARE).** `pages/compare.html` + the PURE `core/data/competitors.js` — a dated `2026-07` landscape survey of ~28 astrology/divination products (astro.com, Astro-Seek, Solar Fire, JHora, Delphic Oracle, Co-Star…), each with ≥1 https source, an ISO survey date, the three honesty axes and a **mandatory "what it does better than this site" list**; a 25×14 honest feature matrix (●◐○? = full/partial/none/unknown); the 11 claim/verify/qualifier novelty claims; client-side staleness badges (amber ≥12mo / red ≥24mo). A superlative-grep test bans best/first/most/unrivalled and unqualified "only"; absence claims are phrased "we found none in our 2026-07 survey" with a standing correction invitation. New callable registry capability `comparison` (`compareTools`, wired into the Grand Orchestrator's `runTool`); new glossary term "Swiss Ephemeris"; named-in-nav + contents/tools under Reference. Core stays DOM-free and motion-free; the wide matrix uses `contain:paint` so the body never scrolls sideways.

### R31 — the Practices wing (the mudrā museum) & the Dhammapada ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-17)**
- **The Practices wing (B-practices-data + B-practices-wing).** A museum of the haṭha-yoga **mudrās (seals) & bandhas (locks)** rendered as history in the manner of the study wings. `pages/practices/{index,mudras}.html` + `app/practices.js` + `app/practices-art.js` + `assets/css/practices.css` (page-scoped, DS-tokens-only, reduced-motion-safe; `style.css` untouched) render **35 records** — the **Gheraṇḍa Saṁhitā's 25** and the **Haṭhayogapradīpikā's 10** — with a `source`-segmented filterbar, a GS↔HYP **crosswalk table** (scrolls in its own box), and yoga-wing-style inline stroke-SVG figures (no raster assets). The pure engine `core/practices.js` + generated data `core/data/practices/mudras.js` (no DOM/rAF/BOM, NFC-clean; every `description/purpose/locus/harmNote/textCaution/contested/sources` field byte-verbatim from the source JSON, only `artId` derived) exposes `mudrasBySource / mudraById / crosswalkOf / practicesStats / searchPractices` over `HATHA_MUDRAS` + the 8-group `MUDRA_GROUPS` taxonomy (the mudrā group `built:true`; the other 7 honestly catalogued/planned with real cross-links to `rasa`, `picatrix`, `kabbalah`, `confluence`, `yoga`, `buddhist`). **Framing & harm discipline:** every field is descriptive-voice ("The text…", never an imperative to the reader) and carries the `PRACTICES_CAVEAT` ("described, never prescribed"). Two in-data corrections are surfaced as ⚑ contested panels, not silently resolved: (1) the **khecarī frenum-cutting** — the plan's "GS omits cutting" claim is **refuted** (Vasu GS 3.25 explicitly instructs cutting), so it is recast as contested and cut in BOTH texts, described in words and flagged but **never depicted** (no "cut" in any art aria-label); (2) the **same-name/different-practice split** — HYP **vajrolī** (a clinical genito-urinary technique, **not diagrammed** — an honest "Not diagrammed" panel replaces any figure) vs GS **vajroṇī** (an inversion figure that explicitly disclaims the genito-urinary risk). Gheraṇḍa edition blocker resolved: loci cite "GS ch.verse (Vasu 1895 / SBH 1914–15)", scan archive.org/details/b28140102. New registry reference entry `practices` (callable:false, mirroring the buddhist-canon P1 precedent — wiring `search_practices` as an assistant tool is a flagged follow-up); 10 "Practices" glossary terms (Mudrā, Bandha, Khecarī, Kumbhaka, Haṭha Yoga, Granthi, Uḍḍiyāna, Mūla-bandha, Kaṇḍa, Viparītakaraṇī); named-in-nav under Traditions + a contents card. Families 2b/2c and the hand-figure builder remain P2 (roadmap stub).
- **The Dhammapada (B-buddhist-dhp).** The Buddhist wing grew from 3 Tier-1 texts to **+Dhammapada 1–75** (vaggas 1–5 of the traditional 26) — `pages/buddhist/dhammapada.html` + `core/data/buddhist/dhammapada.js`, reusing the R30 reading-room render path unchanged (the section rail, previously MN 118-only, now also groups the Dhammapada by its vagga — the only derived field, never part of the reconstruction invariant). Canonical fields reproduced byte-verbatim from the source JSON; the famous cruxes (*manopubbaṅgamā* 1:1, *appamādo amatapadaṁ* 21, *yamāmase* 6:2, *dīpa* "island/lamp") ride in per-record `notes`, both-ways and unresolved. Wing totals now **608 segments / 2,411 glossed words**. The `buddhist-canon` registry entry extends to the 4th text (pages[] + the `id` enum + the "Dhammapada"/"Vagga" glossary terms); the R30 core test's text-count assertions were updated for the 4th text.

### R32 — the Eastern Greats wing (E1) & the atlas's modern yoga-Vedānta figures ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-17)**
- **The Eastern Greats wing (B-east-data + B-east-wing).** A new wing extending the Great Works author→book→chapter pattern to the Indian traditions: a hub (`pages/greatworks/east.html`) + 3 per-author study pages — **Varāhamihira**, **Vivekananda**, **Yogananda** — driven by `app/greatworks-east.js`, which **reuses the Western renderer** (`app/greatworks.js`, made trivially-additive by exporting 5 existing helpers — no behaviour change) off `core/data/greatworks-east.js` (`GREAT_WORKS_EAST`, a **bare author ARRAY** of **3 authors / 11 works / 102 chapters**; pure data, NFC-clean, generated from 3 verified `r32data/*.json`). Each figure's masterwork is mapped chapter-by-chapter onto the tool that **computes what the book describes** — Varāhamihira's *Bṛhajjātaka / Bṛhat Saṁhitā / Pañcasiddhāntikā* onto the Vedic/sidereal engine, muhūrta & the by-hand math layer; Vivekananda's *Raja Yoga* (1896) onto the Yoga Sūtras wing **as his rendering**; Yogananda's *Autobiography of a Yogi* (1946 first ed.) onto the vedic-remedies museum piece + the vibhūti-pāda power-claims. **PD discipline is per edition** (quote-safe vs cite-only badges both live: Iyer 1885 & Sastri 1929 *Bṛhat Jātaka*, Vivekananda 1896, the 1946 *Autobiography* are quote-safe; every post-1946 SRF revision, the *Complete Works* resets & the 1946 *Bṛhat Saṁhitā* are cite-only, with the SRF v. Ananda 1946-first-edition-only PD case study on-page). Every miracle/efficacy passage is catalogued as the **book's CLAIM**, page-cited, never endorsed; contested points keep **both positions** (Varāhamihira's traditional vs modern dates; De Michelis vs traditionalist on *Raja Yoga*). The **Kriya Yoga (Lahiri–Yogananda lineage) vs kriyā-yoga (Yoga Sūtra II.1)** term-collision disambiguation is present on-page and in the glossary. New registry reference entry `great-works-east` (callable:false); **6 new glossary terms** (Bṛhajjātaka, Bṛhat Saṁhitā, Pañcasiddhāntikā, Āyurdāya, Kriya Yoga, Rāja Yoga); reached from the Great Works hub + a contents card (the `greatworks` nav key already routes all 4 pages). Future phases **E2–E4** (Parāśara/BPHS, Buddhaghosa/Milarepa, Ge Hong/Zhang Boduan) remain in `docs/plans/r28/eastern-greats.md`.
- **The atlas's modern yoga-Vedānta figures (B-atlas-east).** The Great Confluence atlas grew **188→190 entries / 151→155 edges** (documented **141→145**; 9 disputed, 1 debunked unchanged): two new `yoga-vedanta` person nodes — **`person-vivekananda`** (1863–1902, siteLink → `greatworks/vivekananda.html`, carrying the De Michelis/traditionalist debate both-ways) and **`person-yogananda`** (1893–1952, siteLink → `greatworks/yogananda.html`, carrying the required Kriya-Yoga disambiguation; miracle narratives framed as the book's claims) — with **4 documented edges** (Vivekananda → the 1893 Chicago Parliament, → *Raja Yoga* 1896, → the Yoga Sūtras; Yogananda → *Autobiography of a Yogi*). `confluence.js` edited by **append only** (existing entries/edges byte-stable, sort order preserved). Varāhamihira is intentionally **not** in the atlas (Jyotiṣa, outside the 9 esoteric lanes — wing/Library only). The R28 `edge-labels.json` bijection stays the original **151 rows** (the 4 R32 edges carry the label fields and pass the dynamic enum checks but are outside that verified json); all count asserts across `engine-test.mjs`, `r28-atlas-labels.mjs` & `ui3-atlas.mjs` updated. New test `r32-atlas-east.mjs`; the hiw-confluence how-it-works note updated to 190/155.

### R33 — the Vedic reading's explain assistant ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-30)**
- **The `vedic` AI layer (B1-ai-layer).** `pages/vedic/index.html` was the last major computed page without an assistant; it now has one, and the covered interpret kinds are `vedic`, `vedicyogas`, `vedicdelineation`. Three new builders in `core/llm-context.js`, to a frozen contract — `buildVedicContext(report, opts) → {system, facts, glossary}`, `buildVedicInterpretPrompt()` (the EXPLAIN task) and `vedicDataBlock(report)` (the compact JSON block) — each degrading to a codebook-only context or an empty string on a null/empty report rather than throwing. **One refactor, no duplication:** `slimVedic` was a local const inside `runTool`; it is hoisted to module scope and `vedicDataBlock` consumes it (`const base = slimVedic(v)`), output byte-identical for a well-formed `castVedic()` result and merely defensive on missing limbs — the test asserts exactly **one** definition of it exists. `app/divination-assistant.js` gains `vedic` in all four maps (CTX / PROMPT / DATABLOCK / SUBJECT, subject word "sidereal reading"); nothing else changed.
- **The codebook — the actual deliverable, and the site's largest system prompt** (~41 kB at the default budget: 45 facts + 47 glossary entries; on a free tier at `maxFacts:14 / maxGlossary:4` the trimming touches only facts and the codebook survives intact). It is assembled from seven module-private constants layered on the existing `JYOTISHI_PREAMBLE` via `assembleSystem()`: **VEDIC_FRAME** (the invariants, including the explicit "do NOT repeat it in every paragraph"), **VEDIC_UNITS** (rūpa = 60 virūpas + the per-graha required minimums; bindu 0–8, SAV per-sign mean ≈28, checksum 337; the 120-year cycle and the balance-at-birth derivation worked through with an example; the dignity ladder; the ayanāṁśa subtraction and precession; what a Dn actually is), **VEDIC_ORDER** (the 9-step canonical reading sequence), **VEDIC_CITE_RULE** (BPHS tr. Santhanam / Phaladīpikā tr. Sareen–Sastri / Sārāvalī tr. Santhanam 1983 / Laghu Parāśarī — plus "say so" where no rule can be cited), **VEDIC_CONTESTED** (yoga conditions, nīca-bhaṅga's three recensions, kendrādhipati doṣa's scope, varga conventions, combustion arcs, Kāla-sarpa as modern, the ayanāṁśa itself), **VEDIC_REFUSALS** (remedies / medical-legal-financial-marital / lifespan-and-death incl. māraka as historical doctrine / muhūrta for a real decision / "what is going to happen" — each written as a short in-voice redirection that gives the explanation actually being asked for), **VEDIC_COMPARE** (lay the two rulebooks side by side, never average, never pick a winner) and **VEDIC_SPEECH** (plain English first, Sanskrit in parenthesis; unit + threshold in the same breath; mechanism before meaning).
- **The facts carry the real reading in the canonical order:** moment/place → ayanāṁśa value + name + the named alternatives → the compare-never-merge rule → Lagna (nakṣatra, pada, lord) → the Lagna lord's bhāva and dignity → the Moon with the % of its nakṣatra traversed → pañcāṅga (with what a tithi and a pañcāṅga-yoga literally measure) → the nine grahas by bhāva → the **ayanāṁśa-fragile** flag → yogas present **and** checked-but-absent (with the engine's small scope declared) → the Ṣaḍbala ranking plus a per-graha row quoting total, required, ratio, the six components and Iṣṭa/Kaṣṭa → the Kāla-bala time-lords → the engine's own declared simplifications (labelled the **site's** limitation, distinct from the tradition's disputes) → D9 and D10 → the balance-at-birth derivation → the running daśā and the full mahā sequence → the SAV per sign and again per bhāva from the Lagna → every computed conclusion line → the reading's citation list.
- **The framing law is test-enforced, not conventional.** `scripts/tests/r33-vedic-ai.mjs` asserts compare-never-merge, ayanāṁśa-is-a-choice, no-demonstrated-validity-said-once, the units key, the cite-the-rule contract with its five named editions, the contested ledger, the five refusals, the canonical reading order **asserted in order**, plus a **banned-register grep** over context + prompt (`you will`, `you'll`, `you should`, `we recommend`, `I recommend`, `wear a`, `is destined`, `guarantee(d|s)`, `will definitely`) with a positive control proving the patterns really match a prescriptive sentence — and a counter-assertion that "remedial" still appears, because describing the doctrine is the job and instructing anyone to act on it is not. Determinism is pinned both ways: `vedicDataBlock` is equal across two calls on one report **and** across two independent casts of the same fixed moment, and the new core block greps clean of `Date.now` / `Math.random` / `new Date()` / `document` / `window` / `fetch`.
- **New per-reading affordance — ayanāṁśa-fragile placements.** The context computes any graha within **1.5°** of a sign boundary — a placement another ayanāṁśa would move into the next sign and therefore the next bhāva — and the interpret prompt requires the model to flag them. On the page's default chart it fires on the Sun (0.68°).
- **The page & app wiring (B2-page-wiring).** `app/vedic.js` exports `currentVedicReport() → { v, chart, moment:{dateISO, offset, lat, lon, place}, conclusions } | null` on the canonical `muhurta.js` pattern (module-level `lastReport`, `reportSubs[]`, guarded `notifyReport()`), with `conclusions = v.conclusions` — computed inside `castVedic`, never a second call. **Stale-reading safety is first-class:** `clearReport()` nulls the report *and* notifies, and fires on all three failure paths (unparseable lat/lon, a panel cast that returned no reading, a thrown cast), so the panel shows its honest empty text instead of narrating a chart no longer on screen. `renderVedicPanel()` now **returns** the `castVedic()` result (null on failure) instead of `undefined` — purely additive, every existing caller ignores it — which is what lets the page hand the assistant *the very cast it drew*: one cast, one reading, no drift. The **place label is honest by construction**: a chosen city preset gives its own name, otherwise the coordinates are the truth and the nearest listed city is offered only as an explicitly-flagged approximation with its distance.
- **Six explain chips, not five** — the five commissioned plus "In what order is a chart read?", since the canonical reading order is something the assistant must make legible. Short labels (390 px-safe), the full multi-sentence question in `data-q` (each interpretive one ending in an explicit "Cite the rule."). Chips are `type="button"` so they can never submit the cast form, and the click path contains **no** call to `send()` and no reference to `#dv-asst-send` — a chip physically cannot fire a request, and filling a textarea costs no API key. **The honest note carries all six framing laws in the page's own voice** (each asserted by name in `r33-vedic-page.mjs`), and the keyless line goes further than the other pages' boilerplate, as a birth-data page must: your birth data is never sent anywhere by this site itself — it stays in your browser (and in the shareable link you choose to copy) and leaves only if *you* press send, and then only to the provider you picked, under your own account. Mount is guarded (`import(...).catch(() => null)`, a missing `#dv-assistant` no-op, a try/catch around init) and happens **after** `run()`, so information precedes the AI in time and not merely in DOM order. Site invariants held: no `requestAnimationFrame`, the chip scroll gated on `prefers-reduced-motion`, `style.css` untouched (the two chip rules are page-scoped, the `muhurta.html` precedent — and the test asserts `style.css` contains no `#v-ai-chips`), `core/**` untouched by B2. `window.__vedicReport()` is added as a test/introspection hook on the `window.__cflNav` precedent, which is what makes the null-before/populated-after assertion drivable in Chromium at all.
- **Integration.** Both suites wired into `scripts/engine-test.mjs` (the isolated-child pattern) **and** `scripts/browser-verify.mjs`'s Phase-2 `MODULES` — the structured drive uses only the existing `assert`/`click`/`evalBeforeLoad` vocabulary, so no new executor verbs were needed. **3 new glossary terms** (`Rūpa`, `Bindu`, `Balance of daśā at birth`, cat *Vedic (Jyotiṣa)*), also added to the `vedic` registry entry's `glossaryTerms` so the registry↔glossary anti-drift assert covers them. `docs/LOCAL-LLM.html`'s diviner section — which had drifted to naming only geomancy/tarot/I Ching — now enumerates **all fourteen** shipped interpret kinds and gains a "The `vedic` kind" note on the codebook, the units, the fragility flag and the refusals. The panel placeholder was re-skinned off the geomancy default (B1's flagged gap in B2's file). One **pre-existing** test bug fixed in passing: `r28-atlas-labels.mjs`'s scratchpad-absent fallback still hard-coded 151 edges after R32 appended 4, so it failed on any machine without the R28 scratchpad; it now derives from `CONFLUENCE_EDGES.length` (the absolute 155 is still pinned by check 1) and cannot go stale again.
- **Known drift, not fixed this round:** `app/synastry.js` and `app/transits.js` mount the panel with `kind: 'synastry'` / `kind: 'transits'`, and neither kind exists in the CTX/PROMPT/DATABLOCK maps — both silently fall back to the **geomancy** builders. Pre-dates R33 and is out of its scope; a one-round fix is either three builders each or an explicit unsupported-kind guard.
- **Final-verifier fix — the budget spine (`core/llm-context.js`, `buildVedicContext`).** The verification pass found that the codebook's numbers were all correct against `core/vedic.js` (required minimums, 1 rūpa = 60 virūpas, BAV 0–8 from eight contributors, the 337 checksum and its ~28 mean, the Vimśottarī order/spans and the `span × (1 − fraction)` balance, the 13°20′ arc, the ~50″/yr precession, the dignity ladder — 20/20) but that **the model was not being shown them on the shipped default path**. `PROV_ORDER[0]` is **groq**, a free kind, so `buildCtx()` sends `maxFacts` **14** for an ad-hoc question and **22** for Interpret, and `interpretBody()` sends **no JSON data block** on a free tier. The facts are pushed in *reading order*, so the plain `facts.slice(0, max)` cut everything from the Ṣaḍbala onward: at 14, not one rūpa, bindu, daśā, D9 or conclusion survived (the trim stopped mid-graha, at Saturn) — while `buildVedicInterpretPrompt()` still commanded §7 Ṣaḍbala, §8 the vargas, §9 the timing layer and §10 the Aṣṭakavarga. The prompt was demanding figures the model had never seen, against a codebook whose one hard rule is *"never invent a position, a bindu, a rūpa or a verse"* — an invitation to fabricate, in exactly the round's own subject matter. Fixed by making the trim **spine-preserving**: `add()` takes a third `spine` flag, twelve summary facts are marked (the 3 frame facts, the Lagna, the Moon, the yogas line, the Ṣaḍbala header, D9, the balance at birth, the running period, the SAV and the SAV-by-bhāva), and `done()` keeps the spine first and then fills with the rest **in reading order**. The returned fact shape is unchanged (`{text, cite}` — the flag is stripped), `maxFacts` is still honoured exactly, and an untrimmed context is byte-identical to before. The Ṣaḍbala header additionally now carries the **total/required→ratio triples** for all seven grahas, so §7 is answerable at *every* budget (and the figures themselves teach the codebook's point: Mercury's 8.54 rūpas ranks **last** because its bar is 7, while Saturn's 6.85 clears a bar of 5). `r33-vedic-ai.mjs` gained a regression block asserting all eleven spine limbs survive at `maxFacts` 14/22/28/45/110, plus the `{text, cite}` shape. **Note for the next round:** B1's `DRIVES` descriptor in `r33-vedic-ai.mjs` is *prose*, so browser-verify only documents it — its claim that the preview shows "the running daśā and the Ṣaḍbala rūpas" was false when written and is true only after this fix. Prose asserts are not asserts.

### OPGRAPH — the operative-corpus graph, the tracked artery & the two-column ledger ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-07-30)**

*Round-number note, stated rather than silently renumbered: MASTER-PLAN's R33 is the Vedic AI layer above; `docs/plans/opgraph/PLAN.md` numbers the opgraph **research** round R33 as well, and the telemetry ledger records the two as `R33` and `R33r`. This build round is **R34**. `OPGRAPH_META.roundId` and every node's `gateRound` say `R33` because that is the round whose research they gate.*

- **The graph (A + B + C).** A new Traditions wing, `pages/opgraph.html`, answering one question the site had never asked in one place: **which historical works actually contain operative procedures, of what kind, and how much of each one survives.** `assets/js/core/data/opgraph.js` ships **508 nodes** — 101 works · 46 authors · 43 cultures · 27 procedure-types · **246 procedure-claims** · **45 relation-claims** — over **747 edges** (CONTAINS 246 · OF_TYPE 246 · REL_FROM/REL_TO 45 each · BELONGS_TO 83 · AUTHORED_BY 74 · HAS_PART 5 · SEGMENT_OF 3), drawn from five audited research slices across the Islamicate, Latin/grimoire, Jewish, Indic and East-Asian corpora. **Every claim is an OP-NODE, not an arrow:** "work X contains procedure Y" and "text A transmitted to text B" are interposed as their own weighted, clickable records between their endpoints, which is what lets a claim be graded, contested, withheld or struck **without deleting the two things it joins**. Completeness is graded on **three axes kept deliberately apart** — what this site records, what the work contains, and what the edition in hand actually gives — because they come apart, and the third is precisely what makes an inaccessible witness visible instead of invisible. **No operative text of any kind is reproduced**, on any node, in any field; `og-artery.mjs` asserts that no node carries a transcription field, and the page's standing note is asserted to *precede* the legend, the index, the diagram and the ledger.
- **THE TRACKED ARTERY — the anti-drift mechanism this repo has been missing (A).** `assets/js/core/data/opgraph.js` is **generated**, and for the first time in this repo the generator is **committed**: `research/opgraph/gate-decisions.json` (hand-authored judgement — 127 source tiers, 114 endpoint dispositions, the 8 audit strikes, the 12 blockers, the node splits, the razor redactions) → `scripts/seed-opgraph-gate.mjs` → `research/opgraph/gate.json` (arithmetic) → `scripts/gen-opgraph.mjs` → the module. Both generators are dependency-free, idempotent and carry `--check`, which rebuilds to memory and exits 1 if the committed bytes differ. **Both `--check`s are now wired into `scripts/engine-test.mjs` as first-class named checks** (`artery: …`) alongside the `og-artery` module that asserts the same thing from the inside, and into `verify-site/SKILL.md` as step 4 — so **hand-editing a generated file is a test failure**, not a silent divergence. The mechanism was verified live during integration, not assumed: appending one comment line to the generated module turned the suite red from both directions and reverting turned it green. **Splitting judgement from arithmetic is what keeps "a weight must be computed, never argued into existence" true when there are 508 of them** — weights are recomputed on every run and a stored weight that disagrees with the recomputed one is a **hard failure, not an override**.
- **The curation gate, and the 119 things it refused (A).** Admission is `weight = witness × primaryFactor × contestFactor × flagFactor` against a **0.40 floor**: **1,255 nodes and edges admitted** (mean 0.62, min 0.42, **below-floor 0**), **102 excluded** and **17 tombstoned**, by reason code — `no-independent-witness` 89 · `out-of-scope` 20 · `duplicate` 4 · `razor-violation` 3 · `licence-blocked` 1 · `misattribution` 1 · `reverses-chronology` 1. The plan's census predicted 623 nodes; **the difference is the gate working**, and every refusal carries a `revisitIf` rather than vanishing. A record is never deleted — it is **moved**, with its strike id, its reason code and the round that ejected it, and the tombstone list is on the page as a first-class table, not a debug view. **Blocker B1 is enforced AND disclosed:** both legs of the awfāq → Ghāya → Agrippa → `kameas.js` chain are excluded (the second on two independent grounds — the unestablished Latin channel, and the rule that an edge endpoint may not be a file path), the observation survives as a retained note and as a stated **data ceiling**, and `og-artery` asserts *both* that the arrow is absent *and* that the disclosure is present, so the blocker cannot be satisfied by quietly deleting the evidence of it.
- **Three findings the build produced that no reader found (A).** (1) **`COMMENTS_ON` cannot enter the ranking DAG** — including it produced exactly two cycles of the same shape (`yijing → ea:yixue-qimeng → yijing`; `gw:weyer-pseudomonarchia → gw:scot-discoverie → gw:weyer-pseudomonarchia`), neither a dating error: a commentary runs later→earlier while a transmission runs earlier→later, so ranking over both **guarantees** a cycle wherever a text and its commentary are both modelled. That is decision D7 generalised, found by the acyclicity assert. (2) **A second arithmetic discrepancy and two live razor hits the hostile audit missed** — the generator's own row/edge cross-check found slice 14's `jew:sar-ha-torah`/purification mismatch (43 rows vs 42 edges; the orphan row is the one strike R1 rewrote, and the rewrite took the edge with it), and the **file-global** razor scan caught the Abramelin ordeal's length reproduced on a harm-flagged ascetic regimen plus a "REPEATED ~18 TIMES" string on the Śāradātilaka. Both are redacted at write time — **a stale redaction is a hard failure, so the rule cannot quietly stop running** — and tombstoned as `razor-violation`. R1's own lesson, working: the scan is file-global, and a record's own compliance prose earns it nothing. (3) **The audit and the rubric convicted the same two rows independently** — strike E3 voided two `complete` grades to null (the Grand Grimoire oath-pact, Clm 849's invocation) and those same two rows then fell below the floor **by arithmetic**, at 0.30 each. Two mechanisms with no knowledge of each other reached the same verdict. Its consequence is shipped honestly: `unstable-plural` and `null + gradeWithheld` both occupy **zero**, so two legend glyphs have no instance this round — **the legend draws them anyway and states the count as zero**, because an empty category with a stated reason is a result and a legend that quietly omits it is not.
- **The round's largest honest caveat, stated in the data and on the page.** **Three fields are DERIVED, not sourced.** No slice wrote `completenessBasis` or `incompletenessKind` and both are mandatory, so both are derived from the evidence prose by a printed cue table **whose default is the weakest value** — `genre-norm` (**217 of 299**) and `constitutive` (**159 of 296**) — with every record carrying a `*Derived` flag and the cue that matched; 17 `harmNote`s come from a standing repo gloss where a slice typed a hazard and wrote none; 40 editions were synthesised from the slice's own best-edition prose, all at `pd: 'unresolved'`. Because genre-norm means only *"as full as its genre usually is"*, it **draws hatched and is excluded from every headline count** — so the honest headline is that **this round can warrant a basis for 82 of its 299 grades**, and the page says so where the grade is shown. One declared deviation from the plan: the harm enum is **15 terms, not 14**, because eight rows type `psychological-destabilisation` explicitly and no planned term covered it — extending the enum and naming the addition in `OPGRAPH_META.harmKindsAddedByData` was preferred to laundering those rows into `ascetic-fasting` or dropping the signal.
- **The pure engine (B) — `assets/js/core/opgraph.js`.** Deterministic with **no seed, because there is nothing to seed**: integer longest-path ranks by Kahn (a node dequeues only once every predecessor is relaxed, so queue order provably cannot change the answer and no tie-break is invented), then a fixed 4-down/4-up barycentre sweep with ties broken by `(sortYear ?? +Infinity, id)`. Deep-equality is asserted across two calls at five option combinations **and across two independently constructed engines**, so determinism is not a memoisation artefact, and source-level purity is grepped (no `Date`, no `Math.random`, no DOM, no `fetch`). **A cycle is REPORTED, never broken:** `assertAcyclic()` runs Tarjan over `TRANSMITS_TO` and returns the actual path; layout still draws, excluding only the cycle-closing arc **from ranking**, and naming every exclusion in `layout.meta.cycleBroken`. The detector is proved live — the test plants a reversed clone of a real claim, asserts the cycle is found, then verifies every consecutive pair in the reported path is a genuine arc. `RECONSTRUCTED_THROUGH` is excluded **structurally**, and the test asserts that asking for it *by name* still adds zero arcs, so a later round cannot flip D7 by passing an option. The **op-node invariant** is asserted from both sides — structurally inside the engine, then re-derived from the raw edge array by the test, so it is not merely whatever the engine chose to check. **Attribution pressure** grades strain in [0,1] rather than the plan's boolean (with the boolean case reducing exactly to the plan's weighted share), exempts `NON_EDGE` and `RECONSTRUCTED_THROUGH` because a recorded non-relation and a philological reconstruction are curatorial *results* rather than weak supports, and is proved **live rather than inert**: the test rebuilds the graph three times with one claim degraded and asserts no node's pressure ever falls and that pressure rises somewhere. It is never printed bare — `ATTRIBUTION_PRESSURE_NOTE` says on its face that the number is repo-computed and not a scholarly finding.
- **The page (C) — and AT parity by construction rather than by promise.** The canvas and the ledger are painted from **one array**, so they cannot drift: 508 ledger rows for 508 records, 119 drawn, and the counter states the difference *in words* ("…389 filtered nodes are not drawn — the cap is 140; the ledger below carries every one of them"). Two layout calls per render — `cap: Infinity` defines the parity set, `cap: 140` defines the picture — so the truncation rule is the **engine's**, including its closure (a claim whose endpoints did not survive is never drawn) and its honest `{shown, total, cap, dropped}` counter, where `shown` is what was drawn *after* closure. Every type the engine lays out is painted and tabled, cultures and authors included (ledger table E), which is what makes parity an exact equality. The honesty mechanics are wired and tested, not styled: acyclicity is displayed either way (a second fixture engine proves the cycle case renders a callout naming each cycle in words, **framed as a finding, not a rendering fault**); a not-asserted relation is visible **by default**, drawn struck, with its reason and its re-assert condition; a withheld grade renders with *"a withheld grade is a result, not a gap"*; a `NON_EDGE` names who confused the two; ⛔ do-not-quote and ⚠ harm carry their notes verbatim; contested blocks print both positions; and an uncomputed check reports itself as **uncomputed, never as passed**. **Grammatical mood is machine-checked** — the test strips tags and asserts no second-person address and no sentence opening with a procedural imperative anywhere on the page; the h1 reads *"what these books tell an operator to do"* rather than *"…tell you to do"* precisely so the page passes its own rule.
- **A real bug the browser sweep found, fixed at the layer it lived in.** A culture label in the corpus can be a full descriptive clause ("Śākta mantraśāstra — the pan-Indian digest/compendium milieu"), and in a `nowrap` index chip it pushed the document **382 px sideways at 390 px**. Fixed with `shortLabel()` (trim at the first natural break; the full string in `title` and in ledger E) plus `overflow-wrap` — and pinned by an assertion that **no index chip exceeds 44 characters**, a guard at the data layer rather than at the pixel.
- **The framing blocker, fixed as a VOICE change and not a censorship pass (D).** `core/talisman.js`'s `steps` became **`attestedSequence`**: every entry re-voiced to third-person attributed description opening with an attributing frame. **Nothing historical was removed** — the aim, the election, the mansion, the materials, the named powers, the design, the consecration and the fixed-star contact all still ship, still cited; what changed is grammatical mood and person. The header **records the imperative sentences it replaced** and the test strips comments before the literal ban on purpose, because *a fix that erases the evidence of what was wrong cannot be reviewed*. The C-1 rule is enforced **at the schema, not by regex**: substance / quantity / processParam are three named typed fields with `normalised: false` a required literal, so on a harm-flagged record the third value **has nowhere to live** and there is no regex to defeat; Saturn (opium) and Mars (blood) carry mechanism-stating harm notes **inside the same object and the same sentence** as the material, so no prefix-truncated extraction can take one without the other. The unit grep bans measured durations and masses but deliberately **not** the word "hour" — a planetary hour is a position in the sky, not a duration, and banning it would have made the rule unshippable and therefore deleted. Follow-through where the same blocker lived in HTML and in the tool surface: `pages/picatrix/talisman.html`'s lede, §2 heading and six worked-example bullets; `llm-context.js`'s `runTool('talismanRecipe')`, its `buildOperationPrompt` step 4 ("A practitioner asks" → "A reader asks about the historical practice") and the talisman fact, which now appends the harm note to the **same fact string** so a truncated context cannot carry the material without it.
- **The two-column round ledger (D) — `docs/ROUND-LEDGER.md`, generated by `scripts/round-ledger.mjs` from append-only `docs/telemetry/rounds.jsonl`.** It asks one question the repo could not previously answer: **is a round producing subject matter, or only instruments?** Three honesty rules live in the arithmetic rather than in prose. (a) A round with null claim counts is **excluded from every window and never counted as zero** — absence of data is not evidence of zero output, and treating it as such would trip the stop condition on nothing but our own silence. (b) C3 requires five rounds carrying a curation census and prints **NOT EVALUABLE** until then; it can never print "ok" for a check it did not run. (c) Every seeded figure renders **(unverified)** — not one of R28–R33r was re-derivable from a script. The file is **append-only *and* correctable**, which are not in tension: `--force` appends a **superseding** row and the ledger renders the newest per id while stating how many corrections sit behind it. Nothing is ever rewritten, and a wrong number can still be fixed — which is the only way a wrong number ever gets fixed rather than lived with. Integration closed C3's input: the `graph` census block is **read out of the shipped data module at record time**, not typed in, because a round should not be asked to self-report how much its own gate refused. PLAN §6.4 predicted this build round "trips C2" at ~0.14 and its own ratio **is** 0.14 — but C2 is a trailing-3 window and R33r's 48 carries it to 0.70; the ledger prints both and **adjusts neither**.
- **Integration.** Nav entry + `currentSection()` route under **Traditions** (`pages/opgraph.html`, key `opgraph`); a contents card; one registry entry `opgraph` (`callable:false`, 17 exports, how-it-works anchor `#hiw-opgraph` on the page itself); **8 new glossary terms** in a new *Operative corpus* category (The Operative Corpus, Op-node, Completeness grade, Completeness basis, The curation gate, Tombstone (ejected record), Attribution pressure) plus **The refresh artery** under *This site* — all eight named in the registry entry so the registry↔glossary anti-drift assert covers them; all four suites (`og-artery`, `og-engine`, `og-page`, `og-framing`) wired into `engine-test.mjs`'s isolated-child list **and** `browser-verify.mjs`'s Phase-2 `MODULES`; the search index rebuilt (114 pages). `sw.js`'s `VERSION` bumped, and the graph is **deliberately NOT precached**, with the reason recorded in the file: its data module alone is ~851 KB — larger than the rest of the shell put together — for one page, so it is runtime-cached on first visit instead. **One cross-builder drift reconciled:** the page's `<meta name="description">` still claimed *105 works* from the plan's pre-gate census where the gate admitted **101**; corrected to the shipped count. (The frozen contract otherwise held: the generated module is A's and was never hand-edited, and the `--check` gate now makes that structural rather than conventional.)
- **NOT DONE, named so it is not mistaken for done.** **The other four orphaned generators were not reconstructed** — blocker B12, a deliberate deferral. `confluence.js`, `practices/mudras.js`, `bhava-phala.js`, `yoga-rules.js` and `greatworks-east.js` all name generators that were **never committed**, so in every one of them nobody can distinguish a rebuild from a hand-edit. Two corrections to the plan's version of that list, found by reading the module headers rather than the plan: `bhava-phala.js` and `yoga-rules.js` name **their own** r28build generators, not the r31 practices one; and `greatworks-east.js` names its generator **without the `scratchpad/` prefix**, so a reviewer grepping for that word under-reports the debt by one module. **The debt is worse-documented than the plan assumed, not smaller.** It is pinned two ways in `og-artery.mjs` — each module must still name its generator string (so it cannot be forgotten) and each named generator must still be **absent** (so a module that earns a tracked artery is forced to *leave* the ledger rather than quietly stay on it) — and `OPGRAPH_META.orphanedGenerators` carries the table. Also open: the three blocker-held works (`jew:sefer-ha-malbush`, `jew:or-ha-sekhel`, `ea:meihua-yishu`) are **held with revisit conditions, not deleted**; `layoutOpgraph` still parks the culture/author gutters far-left, so the page sets a first-paint scroll offset to the first work as a viewport workaround; and B's `og-page` DRIVES descriptor is **prose**, so browser-verify documents rather than executes it — the real interaction evidence is `og-page.mjs`'s own Chromium tier.
- **Final-verifier pass — the headline claim falsified rather than trusted, and three drifts fixed.** Independent re-verification deleted `assets/js/core/data/opgraph.js` outright, re-ran `scripts/gen-opgraph.mjs` from tracked inputs alone and confirmed the rebuild is **byte-identical** (sha256 `23d487fc…c2fd3`, 851,078 bytes, stable across three consecutive runs); every import in the generator and in all four new suites is a `node:` builtin or a repo-relative path, and the only `scratchpad` strings anywhere in them are the **debt ledger's own data** and the prose explaining it. **The graph is reproducible from tracked state alone — the first shipped data module in this repo of which that is true.** The gate was then falsified from four directions in a real tree: injecting one ejection into `gate.json` stripped the node **and cascaded its two edges** (508→507 nodes, 747→745) while the `og-engine` backstop stayed green, proving the strip happens at write time rather than in the assertion; and three hand-edits of the generated module — a trailing comment, a smuggled ejected node, and a single silent `"weight":0.5`→`0.99` — each turned `engine-test` red (2, 3 and 2 named failures respectively, the smuggled node additionally tripping the Amendment-B backstop). Every probe was reverted and byte-identity re-confirmed. **The razor was re-checked against the emitted objects, not the tests:** `runTool('talismanRecipe')` carries no `steps` key and the literal string `"steps"` appears nowhere in its JSON; a sweep of all **88** `attestedSequence` entries across all 11 aims found **no second-person address and no imperative-mood sentence**, every entry carrying an `attributedTo`; **zero** shipped materia records satisfy `isOperableTriple`; and the opium and blood harm notes are present **inside the same string** as the material in both `talismanRecipe` and `buildContext`'s fact line. A 12,986-string scan of all reader-facing prose the round adds found **zero** quoted passages of 60+ characters in any node field. Three drifts of the same class as the `105 works` one the round already caught were found and fixed **in their owning files**: `core/registry.js` typed the plan's advance figure of **121 sources** where the shipped module carries **123** (54 primary · 44 secondary-scholarly · 25 tertiary), now counted from the data; `pages/contents.html` said **"Two completeness axes"** where the page legend, the meta description, `tools.html` and the glossary all say **three**; and `gen-opgraph.mjs`'s build log printed `built.source.length` as "bytes", under-reporting its own 851 KB output by ~6 KB because the module is full of non-ASCII — now `Buffer.byteLength` (a log-only change; `--check` still passes and the output is unchanged). **One honest overclaim corrected on the page itself:** the ledger paragraph promised the diagram and the text mirror carry "the same numbers", and a per-record parity sweep in Chromium found grade, struck, harm, do-not-quote and inversion agree on all **119** shared records, but the gate weight painted on every node face is a ledger **column** only in table A — for a culture, an author, a claim or a type chip it lives in the record the row opens. The sentence now says so rather than glossing it. The page was driven independently at 1440 px and 390 px (**26/26** assertions, 0 console errors): dossier opens by click *and* by ArrowRight+Enter, Escape closes, filters serialise to `location.hash` and reload restores the view, the weight floor narrows 508→99, acyclicity prints its result **and why a cycle would matter**, and at 390 px the diagram's container is genuinely `display:none` — the 119 undrawn faces are **out of the accessibility tree**, so the ledger is not announced twice. Regression spot-drives of R33's Vedic assistant (6 chips prefill, none sends, an invalid cast nulls the report), the Confluence atlas and R28's two-witness delineation columns: **16/16**. Standing gate after the fixes: audit `Problems: 0` (114 HTML / 211 JS), engine-test `all passed` (673 checks, 0 fails), browser-verify `114 pages, 0 errors`, both generator `--check`s OK, `round-ledger --check` current.

### FURTHER ROADMAP (after R21, in rough value order)
1. **Runes (Elder Futhark)** — a 24-stave oracle on the shared diviner engine (medium fit).
2. **Streaming-markdown AI replies** with copy/regenerate.
3. Numerology beyond gematria remains a *weak* engine fit.
4. **Tithi-praveśa + Nakṣatra porutham (kūṭa matching)** — ✅ **SHIPPED (R25, 2026-07-16)**: the two Vedic
   returns-&-compatibility roadmap stubs are now live (`pages/tithi-pravesha.html`, `pages/kuta.html`), both flagged
   for their contested tables and modern-lineage/sensitive-domain framing.

| **Per-mansion talismanic images** (Agrippa II.46 / Picatrix IV.9) | ✅ | `data/mansion-images.js` (28, cited; mansion 22 single-witness & 11 divergence flagged); on `picatrix/mansions.html` & the Master Tool — *2026-06-25* |

| Magic squares / kāmeas; planetary seals/sigils | ⛔ | **not present** (note: kāmeas are Agrippa II.22, not strictly Picatrix — flag clearly if added) |

**Picatrix verdict:** the **computable** heart (mansions, faces, Behenian stars, correspondences,
election, talisman) is implemented and cross-linked. The **textual/ritual remainder** (Mirror
angels, prayer texts, Perfect Nature, mansion images, the planetary-image set, Book IV, magic
squares) is reference-level or absent — acceptable for an honest study edition, but the named
gaps are the Picatrix-completion backlog.

## (B) RANKED GAP LIST (value × effort)

Effort: **S** ≤ ½ day · **M** 1–2 days · **L** 3+ days. Value reflects fidelity-to-text and
educational payoff (never predictive worth).

| # | Gap | Book/Work | Effort | Value | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Significator-weighted chart health** — weight cautions by whether the flag touches the querent/quesited (or natal) significators, not a flat count | Lilly II | M | **High** | The flat count is *alien to Lilly's method*; this is the single most-cited fidelity defect (REVIEW §2) |
| 2 | **Sect-aware Part of Fortune toggle + generalised Lots view** (`core/lots.js`: Spirit, Eros, Necessity, Victory, Basis, Courage, Nemesis) | Lilly I | S→M | **High** | Resolves the sect-fork honestly; clean affine math; unlocks a whole class of Hermetic technique already half-wired |
| 3 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30)** — **Lilly's worked charts as LIVE figures** (Stolen Fish, Ship at Sea, Marriage, Lost Dog) read from the 1647 woodcuts via `chart-from-positions.js`, wheel + dignities + judgement beside his words. `data/worked-charts.js`, `pages/book2/examples.html` | Lilly II | L | **High** | The headline pedagogy gap — shipped (the dog corrected to Mercury, lord of the 6th) |
| 4 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30)** — **House-by-house horary judgement** — `core/horary-judge.js` (`horaryJudgement`) + a live reader & 12-house reference on `pages/book2/houses.html` (inverted sense for sickness/death/prison; contests by the stronger significator) | Lilly II | L | **High** | Book II's bulk — shipped |
| 5 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Per-mansion talismanic images** (`data/mansion-images.js`, Agrippa II.46 + Picatrix IV.9) on the Mansions page & the Master Tool | Picatrix I/IV | M | Med | The acknowledged "second pass" — completed |
| 6 | **Election gating polish** — already gates retrograde/combust/detriment/fall; add **curated mansion-fitness keyword map** (replace naive substring) and **down-weight malefic mansions** | Picatrix | M | Med | REVIEW open item; removes a known false-positive path in the elector |
| 7 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Full six-fold Ṣaḍbala** (Kāla, Ceṣṭā, Dṛk added) + Iṣṭa/Kaṣṭa phala | Jyotiṣa | L | Med | The flagged Vedic follow-up; finishes the JHora strength model. `vedic.js` `shadbala()` |
| 8 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Vedic glossary terms** folded into the auto-linker | Jyotiṣa | S | Med | Closes the cross-link gap. 20 terms in `glossary.js`, wired to registry |
| 9 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Vedic daily/birth remedies** (mantra/japa/deity/yantra/gem; āsana flagged modern; selection algorithmic) | Jyotiṣa | M | Med | The flagged Vedic remedy follow-up; kept historical-described. `data/vedic-remedies.js` + `buildPractice()` |
| 10 | **Glossary completion (Western/Picatrix)** — Election, Profection, Suffumigation, Behenian, Perfect Nature, the two spirit systems | cross | S | Med | Auto-linking is wired; the terms simply need entries |
| 11 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Picatrix III.9 directional spirit system** (3rd system, Liber Antimaquis) in `data/picatrix-prayers.js`, kept distinct | Picatrix III | S | Med | Completes "two of three". Done with the prayers module |
| 12 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Per-planet planetary-image set** (`data/planet-images.js`, Agrippa II.38–44 + Picatrix II.10/III), distinct from decan-face images; in the talisman panel | Picatrix II | M | Med | Completed — the talisman design note now has a backing image |
| 13 | **Structure / Patterns explorer** page — the modular-partition + planetary-week-theorem (24≡3 mod 7, gcd=1) + antiscia-reflection + aspect-harmonics teaching view | cross | M | Med-High | REVIEW's recommended-first experimental; pure teaching, showcases the unification |
| 14 | **Falsification demo** page — permute birth time N× over `fullReading`, plot the verdict/dignity null distribution → in-tool, honest-science centre-piece | cross | M | Med-High | The strongest honesty feature; mathematically + rhetorically clean |
| 15 | **Election heat-map** (7 days × 24 h grid of `rankNow` for an aim; the weekly planetary-hour periodicity emerges) | Picatrix | S | Med | Cheap, visual, reuses `electionScore` |
| 16 | ◑ **PARTLY DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Mobile nav collapse** shipped (14-item bar → accessible hamburger < 880 px, `shared.js`+`style.css`). **Remaining:** breadcrumbs, "every page ≤2 clicks", un-dead-end `correspondences.html` | cross | M | Med | The standing UX debt |
| 17 | **Antiscia woven into judgement** (treat antiscia/contra-antiscia as hidden contacts in the perfection/aspect search) | Lilly II | S | Low-Med | Lilly uses them in judgement; currently display-only |
| 18 | **Decumbiture mode** (6th-house illness, critical days) | Lilly II | M | Low-Med | A named early-plan feature; niche |
| 19 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30)** — **Natal topic readers** — `core/natal-topics.js` reads all 12 Book III topics (house-lord + natural significator + occupants → favourable/mixed/afflicted tone) on `pages/book3/master.html` | Lilly III | L | Med | Book III's back half — shipped (topic Lots described; computing them is R6-2) |
| 20 | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30)** — **Rectification helper** — `core/rectification.js`: Animodar (Ptolemy) + Trutine of Hermes, both contested, every assumption surfaced, reusing the hyleg pre-natal syzygy; on `pages/book3/master.html` | Lilly III | L | Low-Med | Completeness — shipped |
| 21 | ◑ **MOSTLY DONE (2026-06-25)** — **planetary prayer texts** (III.7) ✅ + **Perfect Nature** (III.6) ✅ + a **Book IV** cited summary ✅; still optional: the full per-sign Book IV liturgies & incense recipes (deliberately not reproduced — framing-sensitive) | Picatrix III–IV | M | Low-Med | Describe-never-instruct; the heart is shipped |
| 22 | **Magic squares / kāmeas + planetary seals** (flag as Agrippa II.22, not strictly Picatrix) | (Agrippa) | M | Low | Frequently expected by users; clearly label provenance |
| 23 | **Accuracy finishing** — `accuracy-check` the pitted/azimene/fortune degrees; fill the 4 blank fortune signs; record provenance in-data | Lilly I | S | Med | Closes the only Book I data holes, on the accuracy mandate |
| 24 | **SVG/PNG export + generalised URL-share across all tools** | cross | S | Low-Med | Mostly done in `app/state.js`/Workbench; sweep the remaining tools |
| 25 | ◑ **PARTLY DONE (2026-06-30)** — global `:focus-visible` ring, `aria-hidden` decorative glyphs, responsive coordinate inputs, `<caption>` on the worked-charts ledger, `aria-live` on the Now dashboard. **Remaining:** table `scope`/`caption` across *all* tables, full `aria-live`/contrast review, extend `verify-site` to assert landmarks (the R5 audit agent hit a spend limit) | cross | M | Med | Standing quality debt — Phase R9-1 |

## (C) PHASED ROADMAP

Ordering integrates the already-planned items (REVIEW's R1/R2, the carried Phase 3/4, the
accuracy backlog) with the gaps above, by value/effort. **Every phase ends at the `verify-site`
gate** (audit `Problems: 0` + engine/data headless tests + 0-console-error Chromium sweep) and is
committed (push direct to `origin/main`, or `ship-bundle` if blocked). Run `accuracy-check` before
encoding any contested datum; new data modules use `add-data-module` (provenance per record,
in-data discrepancy flags, a headless test, no DOM in core).

### Phase 1 — Fidelity & correctness *(highest value, mostly REVIEW R1)*
Make the existing engine *truer to the texts* before adding surface area.
1. **Significator-weighted chart health** — gap #1.
2. **Sect-aware Part of Fortune + generalised Lots** (`core/lots.js`, sect toggle, `reading.lots` exposes the seven Hermetic lots) — gap #2.
3. **Election polish** — curated mansion-fitness keyword map; down-weight malefic mansions — gap #6.
4. **Glossary completion** (Western/Picatrix terms) + **Vedic glossary terms** — gaps #10, #8.
5. **Accuracy finishing** — `accuracy-check` the pitted/azimene/fortune degrees; fill 4 blank fortune signs — gap #23.

### Phase 2 — Picatrix completion *(close the named magic-layer gaps; historical framing throughout)*
6. **Per-mansion talismanic images** (Picatrix I.4) — gap #5.
7. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Picatrix III.9 directional spirit system** (3rd system) — gap #11.
8. **Per-planet planetary-image set** (Picatrix II.22–46) — gap #12.
9. ◑ **MOSTLY DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Perfect Nature** ✅, **planetary prayer texts** ✅, **Book IV** summary ✅ — gap #21 (still optional: the full per-sign Book IV liturgies & incense recipes — describe-never-instruct; toxic/illegal substances flagged, never recommended).
10. *(Optional, clearly provenance-flagged as Agrippa)* **magic squares / kāmeas + seals** — gap #22.

### Phase 3 — The mathematician's-lens explainers *(REVIEW R2; teaching + honesty payoff)*
11. **Structure / Patterns explorer** (`pages/structure.html`) — gap #13.
12. **Falsification demo** (`pages/experiment.html`) — gap #14.
13. **Election heat-map** (time-scan grid on the election page) — gap #15.
   *(Lots from Phase 1 #2 feed these; each is a small addition over `fullReading` + the registry.)*

### Phase 4 — Lilly depth: live examples & judgements ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30, Phase R5)**
14. ✅ **DONE** — **Reusable computed-figure path** — `core/chart-from-positions.js` + `app/worked-charts.js` cast a printed figure and render engine output inline.
15. ✅ **DONE** — **Lilly's worked charts as LIVE figures** (Stolen Fish, Ship at Sea, Marriage, Lost Dog) from the 1647 woodcuts — gap #3.
16. ✅ **DONE** — **House-by-house horary judgement** (`horary-judge.js` + live reader) — gap #4.
17. **Antiscia woven into judgement** — gap #17 *(carried to Phase R8-2)*.
18. *(Optional)* **Decumbiture mode** — gap #18 *(carried, optional)*.

### Phase 5 — Book III depth & the Vedic strength/remedy layer ✅ **DONE**
19. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Full six-fold Ṣaḍbala** (+ Iṣṭa/Kaṣṭa phala) — gap #7.
20. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-25)** — **Vedic daily/birth remedies** (historical-only) — gap #9.
21. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30)** — **Natal topic readers** (12 houses) — gap #19.
22. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30)** — **Rectification helper** (Trutine + Animodar) — gap #20.
23. *(Documented out-of-scope unless promoted)* rigorous **Placidian mundane** primary directions.

### Phase 6 — Organize / link / UX / ship *(carried Phase 3 polish)*
24. ◑ **Mobile nav collapse DONE (2026-06-25)**; still: breadcrumbs, ≤2-click reachability, un-dead-end `correspondences.html` — gap #16.
25. **SVG/PNG export + generalised URL-share** swept across all tools — gap #24.
26. **A11y pass** (landmarks/keyboard/contrast/alt; extend `verify-site` to assert) — gap #25.
27. **Final QA** — spot-check ~10 numbers vs external references; refresh `README.md`/`COVERAGE.md`/this plan; ship.

## Dependency notes
- Phase 1 #2 (**Lots**) underpins Phase 3 (the structure/falsification explorers read the lots + registry).
- Phase 2 data adds feed the talisman/election layers already built — **reuse, never re-implement**
  (compose `cautions.js`→`election.js`→`talisman.js`; compose the data modules into `fullReading`).
- Phase 4 #14 (example component) is a prerequisite for #15/#16.
- New capabilities must be added to `registry.js` (the anti-drift test enforces export/page/anchor/term existence) and surfaced in nav/Tools-hub/Workflow so nothing is orphaned.

## Architecture invariants (do not break)
- **No build step**; vanilla ES modules; shared chrome from `app/shared.js` computing root via `import.meta.url`. Never hard-code absolute site paths.
- **Engine stays pure & headless-testable** — computation in `assets/js/core/` (except `chart.js`), DOM in `assets/js/app/`.
- **Data is sourced & flagged** in `assets/js/core/data/` — provenance per record; discrepancies flagged in-data, never silently chosen.
- **Honest framing on everything interpretive**; magic described as history, never prescribed.
