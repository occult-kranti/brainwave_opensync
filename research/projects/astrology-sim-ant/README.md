# Christian Astrology — the interactive William Lilly

An interactive, scientifically-honest study edition of **William Lilly's _Christian
Astrology_ (1647)** — the first complete astrology textbook written in English. It
presents Lilly's three books chapter by chapter and backs every technique with a
**working calculator** built on a verified astronomical engine that runs entirely in
the browser.

> **An honest note.** Astrology has no demonstrated predictive validity and is
> classified by the scientific community as a pseudoscience. This project presents
> Lilly's astrology as a landmark of intellectual and cultural history and as a
> fascinating formal system to learn and compute. The **calculations are real and
> verifiable**; the **interpretations are Lilly's**, offered for study — not as
> guidance. See `pages/about/` for the evidence and citations.

## What's here

| Area | Pages / tools |
|------|---------------|
| **Home** | `index.html` — overview, "find your way", the three books, the tools, the science note |
| **The Master Tool (the Workbench)** | `pages/workbench.html` — **the single master tool** (the old "Unified Master" now redirects here): one moment runs the **whole engine at once** (the `fullReading` spine) **plus the Vedic chart side by side** (toggle at the top), every panel cross-linked via the capability registry, with **JSON / Markdown / SVG / PNG export** and **on-device auto-save** (download the report to keep it). Its **AI assistant** (powered by **Claude**, your own key) sends the **whole reading as JSON** and offers two presets — **🔎 Interpret & advise** (a plain cross-system synthesis) and **📜 Codex** (evocative) — plus an agentic **"plan a working"** box and **in-browser engine tools** (Western, Vedic, and the Picatrix prayers); every reply has a **⤓ save**. See `WORKBENCH.md` and `docs/LOCAL-LLM.html`. |
| **Jagannath Hora — Vedic (sidereal)** | `pages/vedic/index.html` — a **second, independent system**: the Vedic (Jyotiṣa) horoscope as JHora computes it — sidereal zodiac (Lahiri ayanāṁśa), whole-sign houses, the 27 nakṣatras, the **Vimśottarī daśā**, the **Pañcāṅga**, the divisional charts (**vargas** D1–D60), the **Aṣṭakavarga** (SAV), the **full six-fold Ṣaḍbala** (with Iṣṭa/Kaṣṭa), and the traditional **daily & birth practice** (mantra · japa · yoga · yantra · gem — *described, never prescribed*; the graha→āsana map flagged as a modern syncretism). A **🕉 Vedic view** toggle on every calculator shows it **side by side** with the Western chart. Engine in `core/vedic.js` + `core/data/vedic-data.js` + `core/data/vedic-remedies.js`, cited to Parāśara's BPHS and P.V.R. Narasimha Rao. |
| **Workflow & Chapter Map** | `pages/workflow.html` — every chapter of each book → concept → calculation → worked example → tool; the horary & nativity step-flows; the Picatrix election bridge |
| **Tools hub** | `pages/tools.html` — every calculator in one place, with a "what each computes" table |
| **Book I — Fundamentals** | hub, signs/planets/houses reference, **Master Tool** (now with a full **Cautions & chart-health** panel), **Essential Dignity Calculator**, **Planetary Hours**, **Degree Tables** |
| **Book II — Horary** | hub + step-by-step method, **Horary Chart Calculator** (perfection: translation/collection/prohibition/refranation + timing), considerations, house-by-house guide, Lilly's worked charts |
| **Book III — Nativities** | hub + natal method, **Nativity Calculator** (Lord of the Geniture, temperament) |
| **Reference** | **Glossary & Dictionary** (auto-linked in prose), **Master Index**, **Read the Original** (free scans) |
| **About & Sources** | biography, editions, the modern revival, the scientific assessment, technical notes, full citations |

> **For the next contributor:** `HANDOFF.md` has the current state, the architecture rules,
> the verify-in-a-browser harness, and the **bundle-so-it-applies-cleanly** procedure.
> `MASTER-PLAN.md` has the full Lilly × Picatrix vision and the phased roadmap.

### The calculators are real

- **Positions:** geocentric apparent ecliptic longitudes in the *true equinox of
  date* (tropical zodiac) from [`astronomy-engine`](https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy)
  (truncated VSOP87, MIT, ≈1 arc-minute), vendored at `assets/js/lib/astronomy.js`.
- **Angles & houses:** Ascendant, Midheaven, and **Regiomontanus** (Lilly's system),
  Placidus, whole-sign and equal cusps — computed in `assets/js/core/astro.js` and
  validated against published reference vectors.
- **Dignities:** Lilly's essential (domicile/exaltation/triplicity/term/face) and
  accidental point system, the almuten of a degree, the Part of Fortune, the mean node.
- **Horary:** significators, applying/separating aspects with Lilly's planet-based
  orbs and moieties, mutual reception, planetary hours, and the considerations before
  judgement.

### Verification

Validated with `node` + headless Chromium:

- mean obliquity matches the standard value to 5 decimal places;
- the Sun is at **0° Aries** at the March equinox and **0° Cancer** at the June solstice;
- the Sun sits on the **Midheaven at local apparent noon**;
- the twelve Regiomontanus cusps come out strictly in zodiacal order, and all house
  systems agree on the Asc/MC;
- every term-row of the dignity table sums to **30°**;
- all 13 pages load with **zero console errors** and all navigation links resolve.

self-enables GitHub Pages and publishes the site to
`https://occult-kranti.github.io/astrology-sim-ant/`.
