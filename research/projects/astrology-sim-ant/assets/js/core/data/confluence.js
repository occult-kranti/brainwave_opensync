//  data/confluence.js  ·  The Great Confluence — cross-tradition atlas data
//  (R27 "The Great Confluence"; R28 edge epistemic-label pass; R32 Eastern
//  Greats append). PURE DATA. No
//  DOM, no network, no Date, no randomness. Consumed by core/confluence.js
//  (geometry engine) and painted by app/confluence.js. One source of truth for
//  the atlas and the mobile ledger.
//
//  PROVENANCE. Compiled from NINE adversarially-verified research domains
//  (kabbalah, yoga-vedanta, tantra-rasa, buddhist, daoist, alchemy-west,
//  abrahamic-mysticism [→ christian + islamic lanes], confluence-early,
//  confluence-modern). The verification pass logged 109 corrections across the
//  domains; four synthesis entries (person-jung, corpus-hermeticum, picatrix,
//  yijing) were authored to resolve cross-domain edge references and are cited
//  to the same standard. Bodies, sources and contested blocks are reproduced
//  VERBATIM from the verified files — this module rewords nothing.
//
//  R28 EDGE LABELS. Each of the 151 edges now carries an epistemic
//  `label` grading the TRANSMISSION CLAIM itself (not the doctrine): the act of
//  reading / rendering / answering / absorbing is 141 documented,
//  9 disputed, 1 debunked (corpus-hermeticum→kybalion). Each edge
//  also carries `bestCitation` (the single best witness for the claim) and a
//  `note` (why it grades as it does). Merged VERBATIM from the verified
//  r28data/edge-labels.json by (from,to,kind); a bijection is asserted (every
//  edge labeled, every label row consumed). See scratchpad/r28build/gen-data.mjs.
//
//  HONESTY RULES (locked, site-wide).
//   • The atlas plots INFLUENCE, never validity: an edge means "demonstrably
//     read / rendered / answered / absorbed," per its own citation — nothing
//     about whether any doctrine works. The edge `label` grades that claim of
//     transmission: a disputed edge is drawn faded; the debunked edge is drawn
//     faint + struck, never hidden.
//   • Every entry carries an epistemic `label`: documented | disputed |
//     debunked | conspiracy. Debunked / conspiracy material STAYS in the record,
//     drawn recessive, never dressed as documented fact.
//   • `contested` entries carry ≥2 positions, each with its own citation,
//     reproduced verbatim and NEVER resolved by the site.
//   • Techniques are DESCRIBED as historical practice, never prescribed.
//
//  SCHEMA.
//   CONFLUENCE_LANES:  { id, name, glyph, side:'west'|'spine'|'east' }  (9, fixed order)
//   CONFLUENCE_ENTRIES (190; 188 R27/R28 + 2 R32), each:
//     { slug, lane, title, titleOriginal|null, dateText, sortYear (BCE negative),
//       sortYearEnd|null, dateCertainty:'year'|'decade'|'century'|'range'|'contested',
//       kind:'text'|'person'|'event'|'translation'|'institution', place|null,
//       body, technique:string|null, label, sources:[...],
//       contested:null|{flag, positions:[{source,value},...]}, siteLink:null|{href,label} }
//     Sorted by (sortYear, slug).
//   CONFLUENCE_EDGES (155; 151 R27/R28 + 4 R32), each:
//     { from, to, kind:'translation'|'influence'|'commentary'|'synthesis'
//       |'refutation'|'adaptation', body, sources:[...],
//       label:'documented'|'disputed'|'debunked'|'conspiracy',
//       bestCitation:string, note:string }
//     from = the earlier work / source of the act; to = where it landed.
//     Sorted by (from, to, kind); deduped on that triple (kept the richer sources).
//
//  MERGE OPERATIONS APPLIED (merge-instructions.md, exactly): 5 duplicate copies
//  dropped with their unique sources unioned into the kept copy; 4 edge endpoints
//  repointed (wilhelm-golden-flower-1929→event-golden-flower-1929,
//  event-1144-alchemy-latin→event-robert-chester-1144, upanishads→
//  brhadaranyaka-upanisad, taiyi-jinhua-zongzhi→secret-of-the-golden-flower);
//  edges deduped on (from,to,kind); the Pico text↔event pair was already linked
//  (event-pico-1486→pico-conclusions) so no synthetic edge was added.
//  Assertions passed: no dangling endpoints; entry total 188; 29 of
//  151 edges cross traditions; all 151 edges label-matched (bijection).
//
//  R32 EASTERN GREATS APPEND (hand-appended for the Eastern Greats wing, not via
//  the regenerator). Two yoga-vedanta modern figures added — person-vivekananda
//  (1863–1902) and person-yogananda (1893–1952) — plus four documented edges:
//  person-vivekananda→{event-chicago-1893 (influence), raja-yoga-1896 (influence),
//  yoga-sutras (commentary)} and person-yogananda→autobiography-of-a-yogi
//  (influence). All four are `documented`; they carry the R28 edge fields
//  (label/bestCitation/note) but are NOT in the R28 edge-labels.json bijection
//  (that bijection remains the original 151). Entry/edge sort order preserved.
//  Sources reproduced from the R32 verified files (r32data/{vivekananda,
//  yogananda}.json + verify-eastern-e1.md).
//
//  DO NOT hand-edit — regenerate via scratchpad/r28build/gen-data.mjs.

Drawing on Gikatilla's Sha'arei Orah and Ginnat Egoz and harmonizing Kabbalah with Pythagorean philosophy, Reuchlin — like Pico before him — read Jewish sources as prefiguring Christian doctrine; his earlier De Verbo Mirifico (1494) had already argued that the name of Jesus (the pentagrammaton YHSVH) was the unpronounceable Tetragrammaton made pronounceable. The work appeared while Reuchlin was defending Hebrew books against the confiscation campaign begun by Johannes Pfefferkorn.",

With Gershom Scholem's 1925 appointment as lecturer in Jewish mysticism at the newly opened Hebrew University (he became its first professor of the subject in 1933) as the founding precedent, and the Amsterdam, Sorbonne and Exeter chairs as institutions, the book consolidated esotericism studies as a discipline that analyzes such currents without endorsing their claims.",
