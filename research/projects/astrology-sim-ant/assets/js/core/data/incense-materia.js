// ============================================================================
//  incense-materia.js — THE MATERIALS, AS TOKENS, WITH THEIR AMBIGUITIES.
//
//  WHAT THIS IS FOR. planetary-magic.js records each planet's suffumigation as
//  the source names it — one string per planet. That is the right shape for a
//  per-PLANET view and useless for a per-MATERIAL one, which is the question
//  only this corpus can answer: *frankincense is assigned where, by whom?*
//
//  WHY THIS IS HAND-AUTHORED AND NOT PARSED. Splitting those strings on commas
//  would be fabrication dressed as processing:
//    · "opium, etc." — the "etc." is the SOURCE's ellipsis. The list is
//      truncated in the text; a parser would silently report a list of one.
//    · "\"hermits'\" 31-spice" is ONE composite recipe of 31 ingredients that
//      this site does not carry. Expanding it would invent 31 materials.
//    · "28-component lunar" is the same problem at 28.
//    · "aloes wood" (Mars) and "aloes" (Venus) LOOK like the same word and are
//      very likely two different plants — see AMBIGUITIES below. A parser
//      would merge them and produce a false convergence, which is the single
//      most damaging error a comparison view can make.
//
//  So the tokenisation is a JUDGEMENT, recorded here, reviewable, and never
//  computed. Every token names the substance string it was read out of, so the
//  derivation can be checked by eye against planetary-magic.js.
//
//  THE OPERABLE TRIPLE (FRAMING §5, C-1) IS NOT RELAXED HERE. This module
//  carries identity and provenance only — no quantity, no process parameter,
//  no preparation. The harm-flagged rows keep pointing at planetary-magic.js's
//  `suffumigationMateria`, which is where the typed fields live and where the
//  third fact has deliberately been given nowhere to sit.
//
//  SOURCE: Picatrix III.7 and Agrippa, Three Books II, as recorded by
//  planetary-magic.js. The Picatrix chapter attribution is UNDER REVIEW — see
//  docs/plans/accuracy/70-PATCHSET.md on a suspected III.3/III.7 conflation —
//  and every row here inherits that doubt rather than hiding it.

//  THE PRACTITIONER TABLE — a SECOND assignment set, and it disagrees.
//
//  The maintainer's earlier instrument ("The Week of Unequal Hours",
//  planetary_hours.html) shipped its own per-planet incense table, described in
//  its own footer as "the multi-source table of this project". It is a MODERN
//  PRACTITIONER assignment — Tier C — and it is not the Picatrix/Agrippa table
//  above. On five of seven planets the two disagree outright.
//
//  That disagreement is the most interesting thing either table contains, so
//  both ship, attributed, and neither is corrected into the other. The v1 table
//  is also unusually honest about itself: it marks Saturn's myrrh as a modern
//  STAND-IN and says plainly that "Saturn's classical fumes are deliberately
//  harsh" — i.e. it substituted a safe resin for the historical material. That
//  is a substitution, not a reading of a text, and it is recorded as one.
//
//  DO NOT MERGE THE COLUMNS. A reader choosing between "frankincense for the
//  Sun" (practitioner) and "the 31-spice compound and saffron" (Picatrix) is
//  choosing between a living practice and a historical text, and the site's job
//  is to make that choice visible rather than to make it for them.
