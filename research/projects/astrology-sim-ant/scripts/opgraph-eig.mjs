//  scripts/opgraph-eig.mjs — THE ROADMAP, COMPUTED FROM THE GRAPH.
//
//  The operator doctrine this implements (MASTER SETUP DOC v2 §5): "EIG-ranked
//  experiment selection: rank the roadmap by expected information gain computed
//  from DATA STATISTICS, not from model-stated confidence." It was the last
//  §5 mandate still marked QUEUED.
//
//  It is also amendment C applied to planning: the next round is PRINTED, not
//  remembered. Every figure below is re-derived from tracked state on each run,
//  so nothing here is hearsay (amendment E).
//
//  HONESTY ABOUT THE METRIC — read this before trusting a rank.
//  True expected information gain needs a posterior we do not have. What this
//  computes is a stated PROXY:
//
//        score = affected × headroom × leverage / cost
//
//    · affected  — how many nodes the action can touch (counted, not guessed).
//    · headroom  — how much of the weight rubric the action can actually move,
//                  in rubric units. The rubric is witness × primary × contest,
//                  so an action that cannot raise any of those three has
//                  headroom 0 no matter how appealing it sounds.
//    · leverage  — 2.0 if the action unblocks a STRUCTURAL claim the graph
//                  currently cannot make at all, 1.0 if it improves an existing
//                  one. Structural gaps are worth more than polish.
//    · cost      — a coarse ordinal (1 cheap desk-check … 5 a research round).
//                  Hand-set per action KIND and printed, because pretending to
//                  compute effort would be the dishonest part.
//
//  The proxy's weakness, stated: `cost` is a judgement, so the ranking is only
//  as good as those five integers. They are printed with the output precisely
//  so a reader can disagree with the ranking without having to re-derive the
//  statistics underneath it. The statistics are the contribution; the ordering
//  is an argument.
//
//  Usage:  node scripts/opgraph-eig.mjs            (print the ranked queue)
//          node scripts/opgraph-eig.mjs --write    (also regenerate NEXT.md)

// COUNT. This script reads the shipped module, so the number is the truth here.
//
// The original line was `Array.isArray(x) ? x.length : x.witnesses ? 1 : 0` —
// written for the slice shape and applied to the shipped shape, so every count
// >= 1 fell through the truthiness branch and became 1. That made the entire
// graph look single-witness and inflated action A's `affected` from 115 to 347.
// The weights were never wrong (the gate reads the array shape correctly); the
// ROADMAP was. Guarded by scripts/tests/og-eig.mjs so it cannot regress silently.
